## i-PI documentation

This folder contains the files needed to locally build the documentation for i-PI. 

* `latex/`  contains the "legacy" TeX manual, that includes also autogenerated input reference
* `scripts/`  contains automatic scripts to build the input reference
* `src/` contains RST files that are compiled by sphynx into the HTML documentation.


To make the docs, make sure you have all the needed packages in `requirements.txt` installed, which can be achieved with `pip install -r requirements.txt`, and type `make html`. The local documentation will be generated in `_build/html`. 

The input documentation is automatically generated based on the helpstrings in the input folder.
When you add a new tag, you should also add an entry into `scripts/help.py` to have it added 
to the documentation.

To make the TeX docs follow the instructions in `latex`.
