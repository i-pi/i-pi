In collective-variable biasing, we first discuss methods stemming from thermodynamic integration that use mean force biasing, including the adaptive biasing force algorithm and temperature acceleration. We then turn to methods that use bias potentials, including umbrella sampling and metadynamics. We next consider parallel tempering and replica-exchange methods.

  abstract = {A generic statistical mechanical model is presented for the self-assembly of chiral rod-like units, such as beta-sheet-forming peptides, into helical tapes, which with increasing concentration associate into twisted ribbons (double tapes), fibrils (twisted stacks of ribbons), and fibers (entwined fibrils). The finite fibril width and helicity is shown to stem from a competition between the free energy gain from attraction between ribbons and the penalty because of elastic distortion of the intrinsically twisted ribbons on incorporation into a growing fibril. Fibers are stabilized similarly. The behavior of two rationally designed 11-aa residue peptides, P(11)-I and P(11)-II, is illustrative of the proposed scheme. P(11)-I and P(11)-II are designed to adopt the beta-strand conformation and to self-assemble in one dimension to form antiparallel beta-sheet tapes, ribbons, fibrils, and fibers in well-defined solution conditions. The energetic parameters governing self-assembly have been estimated from the experimental data using the model. The 8-nm-wide fibrils consist of eight tapes, are extremely robust (scission energy approximately 200 k(B)T), and sufficiently rigid (persistence length l(fibril) approximately 20-70 microm) to form nematic solutions at peptide concentration c approximately 0.9 mM (volume fraction approximately 0.0009 vol/vol), which convert to self-supporting nematic gels at c {\textgreater} 4 mM. More generally, these observations provide a new insight into the generic self-assembling properties of beta-sheet-forming peptides and shed new light on the factors governing the structures and stability of pathological amyloid fibrils in vivo. The model also provides a prescription of routes to novel macromolecules based on a variety of self-assembling chiral units, and protocols for extraction of the associated energy changes.},

  abstract = {Water deviates from tetrahedral symmetry on different scales, creating "defects" that are important for its dynamics. In this Account, I trace the manifestations of these distortions from the isolated molecule through gas-phase clusters to the liquid phase. Unlike the common depiction, an isolated water molecule has a nonsymmetric charge distribution: although its positive charge is localized at the hydrogens, the negative charge is smeared between the lone-pair sites. This creates a "negativity track" along which a positive charge may slide. Consequently, the most facile motion within the water dimer is a reorientation of the hydrogen-bond (HB) accepting molecule (known as an "acceptor switch"), such that the donor hydrogen switches from one lone pair to the other. Liquid water exhibits asymmetry between donor and acceptor HBs. Molecular dynamics simulations show that the water oxygens accepting HBs from the central molecule are spatially localized, whereas water hydrogens donating HBs to it are distributed along the negativity track. This asymmetry is manifested in a wider acceptor- versus donor-HB distribution. There is a higher probability for a water molecule to accept one (trigonal symmetry) or three HBs than to donate one or three HBs. A simple model can explain semiquantitatively how these distributions evolve by distorting perfectly tetrahedral water. Just two reactions are required: the dissociation of a HB between a double-donor donating to a double-acceptor, D(2){\textperiodcentered}{\textperiodcentered}{\textperiodcentered}A(2), followed by a switching reaction in which a HB donor rotates its hydrogen between two double-acceptor molecules. The preponderance of D(2){\textperiodcentered}{\textperiodcentered}{\textperiodcentered}A(2) dissociation events is in line with HB "anticooperativity", whereas positive cooperativity is exhibited by conditional HB distributions: a molecule with more acceptor bonds tends to have more donor bonds and vice versa. Quantum mechanically, such an effect arises from intermolecular charge transfer, but it is observed even for fixed-charge water models. Possibly, in the liquid state this is partly a collective effect, for example, a more ordered hydration shell that enhances the probability for both acceptor and donor HBs. The activation energy for liquid water self-diffusion is considerably larger than its HB strength, pointing to the involvement of collective dynamics. The remarkable agreement between the temperature dependence of the water self-diffusion coefficient and its Debye relaxation time suggests that both share the same mechanism, likely consisting of coupled rotation and translation with collective rearrangement of the environment. The auto-correlation function of a hydrogen-bonded water molecule pair is depicted quantitatively by the solution of the diffusion equation for reversible geminate recombination, up to long times where the ubiquitous t(-3/2) power law prevails. From the model, one obtains the HB dissociation and formation rate coefficients and their temperature dependence. Both have a similar activation enthalpy, suggesting rapid formation of HBs with alternate partners, perhaps by the HB switching reaction involving the trigonal site. A detailed picture of how small fluctuations evolve into large-scale molecular motions in water remains elusive. Nonetheless, our results demonstrate how the plasticity of water can be traced to its asymmetric charge distribution, with duality between tetrahedral and trigonal ligation states.},

  abstract  = {We describe a complete set of algorithms for ab initio molecular simulations based on numerically tabulated atom-centered orbitals (NAOs) to capture a wide range of molecular and materials properties from quantum-mechanical first principles. The full algorithmic framework described here is embodied in the Fritz Haber Institute "ab initio molecular simulations" (FHI-aims) computer program package. Its comprehensive description should be relevant to any other first-principles implementation based on NAOs. The focus here is on density-functional theory (DFT) in the local and semilocal (generalized gradient) approximations, but an extension to hybrid functionals, Hartree-Fock theory, and MP2/GW electron self-energies for total energies and excited states is possible within the same underlying algorithms. An all-electron/full-potential treatment that is both computationally efficient and accurate is achieved for periodic and cluster geometries on equal footing, including relaxation and ab initio molecular dynamics. We demonstrate the construction of transferable, hierarchical basis sets, allowing the calculation to range from qualitative tight-binding like accuracy to meV-level total energy convergence with the basis set. Since all basis functions are strictly localized, the otherwise computationally dominant grid-based operations scale as O(N) with system size N. Together with a scalar-relativistic treatment, the basis sets provide access to all elements from light to heavy. Both low-communication parallelization of all real-space grid based algorithms and a ScaLapack-based, customized handling of the linear algebra for all matrix operations are possible, guaranteeing efficient scaling (CPU time and memory) up to massively parallel computer systems with thousands of CPUs.},

There are intrinsic difficulties in obtaining accurate experimental values, and the previous approaches to compute $\gamma$sl with atomistic simulations are computationally demanding. We present an approach which is to obtain $\gamma$sl from a free-energy map of the phase transition reconstructed by metadynamics. We apply this to the benchmark case of a Lennard-Jones potential, and the results confirm the most reliable data obtained previously. We demonstrate several advantages of our approach: it is simple to implement, robust and free of hysteresis problems, it allows a rigorous and unbiased estimate of the statistical uncertainty, and it returns a good estimate of the thermodynamic limit with system sizes of a just a few hundred atoms. It is therefore attractive for applications which require more realistic and specific models of interatomic forces. {\textcopyright} 2010 The American Physical Society.},

A fully atomistic description of the protein and the surrounding solvent molecules is used, and this complex energy landscape is sampled by means of parallel tempering metadynamics simulations. The ensemble of configurations explored is analyzed using the recently proposed sketch-map algorithm. Further simulations allow us to probe how mutations affect the structures adopted by this protein. We find that many of the configurations adopted by a mutant are the same as those adopted by the wild-type protein. Furthermore, certain mutations destabilize secondary-structure-containing configurations by preventing the formation of hydrogen bonds or by promoting the formation of new intramolecular contacts. Our analysis demonstrates that machine-learning techniques can be used to study the energy landscapes of complex molecules and that the visualizations that are generated in this way provide a natural basis for examining how the stabilities of particular configurations of the molecule are affected by factors such as temperature or structural mutations.},

  abstract = {We present improvements on our previous approaches for calculating vibrational spectroscopy observables for the OH stretch region of dilute HOD in liquid D2O. These revised approaches are implemented to calculate IR and isotropic Raman spectra, using the SPC/E simulation model, and the results are in good agreement with experiment. We also calculate observables associated with three-pulse IR echoes: the peak shift and 2D-IR spectrum. The agreement with experiment for the former is improved over our previous calculations, but discrepancies between theory and experiment still exist. Using our proposed definition for hydrogen bonding in liquid water, we decompose the distribution of frequencies in the OH stretch region in terms of subensembles of HOD molecules with different local hydrogen-bonding environments. Such a decomposition allows us to make the connection with experiments and calculations on water clusters and more generally to understand the extent of the relationship between transition frequency and local structure in the liquid.},

  abstract      = {We formulate the Kohn-Sham density functional theory (KS-DFT) as a statistical theory in which the electron density is determined from an average of correlated stochastic densities in a trace formula. The key idea is that it is sufficient to converge the total energy per electron to within a predefined statistical error in order to obtain reliable estimates of the electronic band structure, the forces on nuclei, the density and its moments, etc. The fluctuations in the total energy per electron are guaranteed to decay to zero as the system size increases. This facilitates “self-averaging” which leads to the first ever report of sublinear scaling KS-DFT electronic structure. The approach sidesteps calculation of the density matrix and thus, is insensitive to its evasive sparseness, as demonstrated here for silicon nanocrystals. The formalism is not only appealing in terms of its promise to far push the limits of application of KS-DFT, but also represents a cognitive change in the way we think of electronic structure calculations as this stochastic theory seamlessly converges to the thermodynamic limit.},

The existence of chloride-hydronium (Cl(-){\textperiodcentered}{\textperiodcentered}{\textperiodcentered}H3O(+)) contact ion pairs even in moderate concentration hydrochloric acid (2.5 m) demonstrates that the counterions do not behave merely as spectators. Through comparison of recent extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) measurements to state-of-the-art density functional theory (DFT) simulations, we are able to obtain a unique view into the molecular structure of medium-to-high concentrated electrolytes. Here we report that the Cl(-){\textperiodcentered}{\textperiodcentered}{\textperiodcentered}H3O(+) contact ion pair structure persists throughout the entire concentration range studied and that these structures differ significantly from moieties studied in microsolvated hydrochloric acid gas phase clusters. Characterizing distinct populations of these ion pairs gives rise to a novel molecular level description of how to view the reaction network for acid dissociation and how it relates to our picture of acid-base equilibria.},

  abstract = {We present a simple approach to calculate the solid-liquid interfacial free energy. This new method is based on the classical nucleation theory. Using the molecular dynamics simulation, we employ spherical crystal nuclei embedded in the supercooled liquids to create an ideal model of a homogeneous nucleation. The interfacial free energy is extracted by fitting the relation between the critical nucleus size and the reciprocal of the critical undercooling temperature. The orientationally averaged interfacial free energy is found to be 0.302+/-0.002 (in standard LJ unit). The temperature dependence of the interfacial free energy is also obtained in this work. We find that the interfacial free energy increases slightly with increasing temperature. The positive temperature coefficient of the interfacial free energy is in qualitative agreement with Spaepen's analysis [Solid State Phys. 47, FS181 (1994)] and Turnbull's empirical estimation [J. Appl. Phys. 21, 1022 (1950)].},

  abstract = {Networks are increasingly recognized as important building blocks of various systems in nature and society. Water is known to possess an extended hydrogen bond network, in which the individual bonds are broken in the sub-picosecond range and still the network structure remains intact. We investigated and compared the topological properties of liquid water and methanol at various temperatures using concepts derived within the framework of graph and network theory (neighbour number and cycle size distribution, the distribution of local cyclic and local bonding coefficients, Laplacian spectra of the network, inverse participation ratio distribution of the eigenvalues and average localization distribution of a node) and compared them to small world and Erdős-R{\{}{\'{e}}{\}}nyi random networks. Various characteristic properties (e.g. the local cyclic and bonding coefficients) of the network in liquid water could be reproduced by small world and/or Erdős-R{\{}{\'{e}}{\}}nyi networks, but the ring size distribution of water is unique and none of the studied graph models could describe it. Using the inverse participation ratio of the Laplacian eigenvectors we characterized the network inhomogeneities found in water and showed that similar phenomena can be observed in Erdős-R{\{}{\'{e}}{\}}nyi and small world graphs. We demonstrated that the topological properties of the hydrogen bond network found in liquid water systematically change with the temperature and that increasing temperature leads to a broader ring size distribution. We applied the studied topological indices to the network of water molecules with four hydrogen bonds, and showed that at low temperature (250 K) these molecules form a percolated or nearly-percolated network, while at ambient or high temperatures only small clusters of four-hydrogen bonded water molecules exist.},

  abstract  = {{\textcopyright} 2017 IOP Publishing Ltd. Interfaces between different materials and phases play a crucial role in many physical and chemical phenomena. When performing simulations of matter at the atomic scale, however, it is often not trivial to characterize these interfaces, particularly when they are rough or diffuse. Here we discuss a generalization of a construction, due to Willard and Chandler, that allows one to obtain a smooth dividing surface that follows the irregular, ever changing shape of these fluctuating interfaces. We show how this construction can be used to study the surface that separates a solid material from its melt and how analyses of the Fourier modes for the capillary fluctuations of this instantaneous dividing surface can be performed. This particular analysis is useful as one can compute the specific free energy excess of the interface, and its dependence on orientation relative to the bulk phases, from the average amplitude of the Fourier modes. We therefore discuss the efficiency of this approach, both in terms of system size and statistical sampling.},

This article presents a practical convex hull algorithm that combines the two-dimensional Quick- hull Algorithm with the general-dimension Beneath-Beyond Algorithm. It is similar to the randomized, incremental algorithms for convex hull and Delaunay triangulation. We provide empirical evidence that the algorithm runs faster when the input contains nonextreme points and that it uses less memory. Computational geometry algorithms have traditionally assumed that input sets are well behaved. When an algorithm is implemented with floating-point arithmetic, this assumption can lead to serious errors. We briefly describe a solution to this problem when computing the convex hull in two, three, or four dimensions. The output is a set of “thick” facets that contain all possible exact convex hulls of the input. A variation is effective in five or more dimensions.},

  abstract = {Neural networks offer an unbiased and numerically very accurate approach to represent high-dimensional ab initio potential-energy surfaces. Once constructed, neural network potentials can provide the energies and forces many orders of magnitude faster than electronic structure calculations, and thus enable molecular dynamics simulations of large systems. However, Cartesian coordinates are not a good choice to represent the atomic positions, and a transformation to symmetry functions is required. Using simple benchmark systems, the properties of several types of symmetry functions suitable for the construction of high-dimensional neural network potential-energy surfaces are discussed in detail. The symmetry functions are general and can be applied to all types of systems such as molecules, crystalline and amorphous solids, and liquids.},

A large variety of efficient potentials has been proposed in the literature, but often the optimum functional form is difficult to find and strongly depends on the particular system. In recent years, artificial neural networks (NN) have become a promising new method to construct potentials for a wide range of systems. They offer a number of advantages: they are very general and applicable to systems as different as small molecules, semiconductors and metals; they are numerically very accurate and fast to evaluate; and they can be constructed using any electronic structure method. Significant progress has been made in recent years and a number of successful applications demonstrate the capabilities of neural network potentials. In this Perspective, the current status of NN potentials is reviewed, and their advantages and limitations are discussed.},

Our approach can easily be applied to any type of pseudopotential, and also has the advantage that it can be used to obtain estimates of the atomic forces that would arise if the real atoms were present, thus giving insight into the expected displacements in the real alloy. We have applied this VCA technique within the Vanderbilt ultrasoft-pseudopotential scheme to predict dielectric and piezoelectric properties of the Pb(Zr0.5Ti0.5)O-3 solid solution in its paraelectric and ferroelectric phases, respectively. Comparison with calculations performed on ordered alloy supercells and with data on parents compounds demonstrates the adequacy of using the VCA for this perovskite solid solution. In particular, the VCA approach reproduces the anomalous Born effective charges and the large value of the piezoelectric coefficients.},

Expressions have been obtained for the scattered light intensity considering both the coherent and incoherent contributions. In that coherent contributions are also considered in this treatment, it goes beyond the scope of previous studies. It is shown that, for molecules of low symmetry, elliptically polarized light must be used in order to determine five independent quadratic forms in the 18 symmetric components (betaijk+betaikj). According to the present results, the apparent discrepancy between the observed value of [fraction one-third] for the depolarization ratio for {\{}CCl4{\}} and the value to be expected from theory may be due to the fact that the coherent contribution had been neglected in previous theoretical considerations. In general, orientational correlation is essential if there is to be appreciable contribution from coherent scattering. For macromolecules, this constitutes a major difference between single- and double-quantum scattering, and additional information may be expected if the latter is investigated experimentally.},

The nature of the unfolded state in both solutions has been analyzed: in urea solution the addition of denaturants acts to expand the denatured state, while in pure water solution the unfolded state is noticeably more compact. For what concerns the mechanism by which urea acts as a denaturant, a preferential direct interaction between urea molecules and protein backbone has been found. However, the bias toward urea solvation is largest at intermediate values of the gyration radius.},

HB plot offers a simple way of analyzing protein secondary and tertiary structure. Moreover, hydrogen bonds stabilizing secondary structural elements and those formed between distant amino residues--defined as tertiary hydrogen bonds--can be easily distinguished in HB plot, thus, amino acid residues involved in stabilizing protein structure and function can be easily identified. By analyzing the network of tertiary interactions the possible spread of information within a protein can be investigated as well. The alteration in tertiary hydrogen bonding network during conformational transitions were investigated through case studies; and showed the applicability of HB plot in exploring mechanistic details in proteins.},

Experimental pollinations indicate that L. cestroides is self-incompatible since fruits were obtained only under cross-, and open-pollination treatments. However, in self- and geitonogamous hand pollinations, as well as in autonomous self-pollination, pollen tubes developed successfully and reached the ovules. The speed of pollen tube growth did not differ significantly among the different hand-pollinated flowers (cross-, self-, and geitonogamous). These facts indicate the presence of an ovarian self-incompatibility system. Significant differences were observed in fruit set, fruit size, and seed number per fruit between cross-pollinated flowers and open pollination (control).

The generative model makes efficient conformational sampling possible and provides a framework for the rigorous analysis of local sequence-structure correlations in the native state.

We have recorded the concentration-dependent terahertz absorption coefficients of N-acetyl-glycine-amide (NAGA), N-acetyl-glycine-methylamide (NAGMA), N-acetyl-leucine-amide (NALA), N-acetyl-leucine-methylamide (NALMA), and N-acetyl-tryptophan-amide (NATA) in aqueous solution. We find a dramatic decrease in the THz absorption, if the number of water molecules per solute is less than 18-20. This change is taken as a signature for the breakdown of peptide-water network motions, which supports the hypothesis that a minimum number of hydration waters is required to activate these motions. This is well below a monolayer coverage of the model peptides. It is interesting to note that the required hydration level corresponds to the number of water molecules which are required for biological functionality.},

  abstract = {Markov state models (MSMs) are a powerful tool for modeling both the thermodynamics and kinetics of molecular systems. In addition, they provide a rigorous means to combine information from multiple sources into a single model and to direct future simulations/experiments to minimize uncertainties in the model. However, constructing MSMs is challenging because doing so requires decomposing the extremely high dimensional and rugged free energy landscape of a molecular system into long-lived states, also called metastable states. Thus, their application has generally required significant chemical intuition and hand-tuning. To address this limitation we have developed a toolkit for automating the construction of MSMs called MSMBUILDER (available at https://simtk.org/home/msmbuilder). In this work we demonstrate the application of MSMBUILDER to the villin headpiece (HP-35 NleNle), one of the smallest and fastest folding proteins. We show that the resulting MSM captures both the thermodynamics and kinetics of the original molecular dynamics of the system. As a first step toward experimental validation of our methodology we show that our model provides accurate structure prediction and that the longest timescale events correspond to folding.},

  abstract = {We examine the short-time accuracy of a class of approximate quantum dynamical techniques that includes the centroid molecular dynamics (CMD) and ring polymer molecular dynamics (RPMD) methods. Both of these methods are based on the path integral molecular dynamics (PIMD) technique for calculating the exact static equilibrium properties of quantum mechanical systems. For Kubo-transformed real-time correlation functions involving operators that are linear functions of positions or momenta, the RPMD and (adiabatic) CMD approximations differ only in the choice of the artificial mass matrix of the system of ring polymer beads that is employed in PIMD. The obvious ansatz for a general method of this type is therefore to regard the elements of the PIMD (or Parrinello-Rahman) mass matrix as an adjustable set of parameters that can be chosen to improve the accuracy of the resulting approximation. We show here that this ansatz leads uniquely to the RPMD approximation when the criterion that is used to select the mass matrix is the short-time accuracy of the Kubo-transformed correlation function. In particular, we show that the leading error in the RPMD position autocorrelation function is O(t(8)) and the error in the velocity autocorrelation function is O(t(6)), for a general anharmonic potential. The corresponding errors in the CMD approximation are O(t(6)) and O(t(4)), respectively.},

They introduce two variables that are able to describe the position of a point in configurational space relative to a preassigned path. With the help of these two variables the authors combine features of approaches such as metadynamics or umbrella sampling with those of path based methods. This allows global searches in the space of paths to be performed and a new variational principle for the determination of low free energy paths to be established. Contrary to metadynamics or umbrella sampling the path can be described by an arbitrary large number of variables, still the energy profile along the path can be calculated.

  abstract      = {Last year, at least 30,000 scientific papers used the Kohn-Sham scheme of density functional theory to solve electronic structure problems in a wide variety of scientific fields, ranging from materials science to biochemistry to astrophysics. Machine learning holds the promise of learning the kinetic energy functional via examples, by-passing the need to solve the Kohn-Sham equations. This should yield substantial savings in computer time, allowing either larger systems or longer time-scales to be tackled, but attempts to machine-learn this functional have been limited by the need to find its derivative. The present work overcomes this difficulty by directly learning the density-potential and energy-density maps for test systems and various molecules. Both improved accuracy and lower computational cost with this method are demonstrated by reproducing DFT energies for a range of molecular geometries generated during molecular dynamics simulations. Moreover, the methodology could be applied directly to quantum chemical calculations, allowing construction of density functionals of quantum-chemical accuracy.},

The system is then described by an effective temperature-dependent harmonic Hamiltonian, which can be used to estimate the system's properties, such as its free energy or its vibrational spectrum. The numerical bottleneck of the method is the evaluation of Gaussian averages of the potential energy and its derivatives. Several algorithmic ideas/tricks are introduced to reduce the cost of such integration by orders of magnitude, e.g., relative to that of the previous implementation of the SCP approach by Calvo et al. [J. Chem. Phys. 133, 074303 (2010)]. One such algorithmic improvement is the replacement of standard Monte Carlo integration by quasi-Monte Carlo integration utilizing low-discrepancy sequences. The performance of the method is demonstrated on the calculation of vibrational frequencies of pyrene. It is then applied to compute the free energies of five isomers of water hexamer using the WHBB potential of Bowman and co-workers [J. Chem. Phys. 134, 094509 (2011)]. The present results predict the hexamer prism being thermodynamically most stable, with the free energy of the hexamer cage being about 0.2 kcal mol(-1) higher at all temperatures below T = 200 K.},

  abstract  = {Using molecular dynamics simulations and the capillary fluctuation method, we have calculated the anisotropic crystal-melt interfacial free energy and stiffness of aluminum in a rapid solidification system where a temperature gradient is applied to enforce thermal non-equilibrium. To calculate these material properties, the standard capillary fluctuation method typically used for systems in equilibrium has been modified to incorporate a second-order Taylor expansion of the interfacial free energy term. The result is a robust method for calculating interfacial energy, stiffness and anisotropy as a function of temperature gradient using the fluctuations in the defined interface height. This work includes the calculation of interface characteristics for temperature gradients ranging from 11 to 34??K/nm. The captured results are compared to a thermal equilibrium case using the same model and simulation technique with a zero gradient definition. We define the temperature gradient as the change in temperature over height perpendicular to the crystal-melt interface. The gradients are applied in MD simulations using defined thermostat regions on a stable solid-liquid interface initially in thermal equilibrium. The results of this work show that the interfacial stiffness and free energy for aluminum are dependent on the magnitude of the temperature gradient, however the anisotropic parameters remain independent of the non-equilibrium conditions applied in this analysis. The relationships of the interfacial free energy/stiffness are determined to be linearly related to the thermal gradient, and can be interpolated to find material characteristics at additional temperature gradients.},

Preliminary searches for migration mechanisms have been performed using metadynamics simulations. Local minima and transition states have been further refined by using the nudged-elastic-band method. Barriers for diffusion from plausible adsorption sites as low as 0.2 eV have been found, but trap states have also been spotted, leading to a more stable configuration, with escape barriers of 0.7 eV. Diffusion among weakly bound physisorbed states is also possible with very low activation barriers ({\textless}50 meV). However, desorption mechanisms (either as SiH3 or as SiH4) from physisorbed or more strongly bound adsorption configurations turn out to have activation energies similar to diffusion barriers.

It is a purely quantum mechanical effect, which can be computed exactly using simulations based on the path integral formalism. Here we discuss how these techniques can be made dramatically more efficient, and how they ultimately outperform quasi-harmonic approximations to treat quantum liquids not only in terms of accuracy, but also in terms of computational cost. To achieve this goal we introduce path integral quantum mechanics estimators based on free energy perturbation, which enable the evaluation of isotope effects using only a single path integral molecular dynamics trajectory of the naturally abundant isotope. We use as an example the calculation of the free energy change associated with H/D and (16)O/(18)O substitutions in liquid water, and of the fractionation of those isotopes between the liquid and the vapor phase. In doing so, we demonstrate and discuss quantitatively the relative benefits of each approach, thereby providing a set of guidelines that should facilitate the choice of the most appropriate method in different, commonly encountered scenarios. The efficiency of the estimators we introduce and the analysis that we perform should in particular facilitate accurate ab initio calculation of isotope effects in condensed phase systems.},

It lends itself naturally to linear scaling as soon as the sparsity of the system's density matrix is exploited. By using a combination of polynomial expansion and Newton-like iterative techniques, an arbitrarily large number of terms can be employed in the expansion, overcoming some of the difficulties encountered in previous papers. Moreover, this hybrid approach allows us to obtain a very favorable scaling of the computational cost with increasing inverse temperature, which makes the method competitive with other Fermi operator expansion techniques. After performing an in-depth theoretical analysis of computational cost and accuracy, we test our approach on the density functional theory Hamiltonian for the metallic phase of the LiAl alloy.},

We find that on the clean surface SiH3 undergoes stepwise decompositions into Si and H adatoms according to SiH3 → SiH2 +H→SiH+2H→Si+3H with an overall reaction barrier of the order of 0.8 eV, consistent with the scenario inferred from secondary ion mass spectroscopy data. The lifetime of SiH3 at room temperature calculated within transition state theory in the harmonic approximation is in agreement with experiments.

Efficiently sampling such a wide range of frequencies provides a considerable thermostatting challenge. Here we introduce a simple stochastic path integral Langevin equation (PILE) thermostat which exploits an analytic knowledge of the free path integral normal mode frequencies. We also apply a recently developed colored noise thermostat based on a generalized Langevin equation (GLE), which automatically achieves a similar, frequency-optimized sampling. The sampling efficiencies of these thermostats are compared with that of the more conventional Nos{\'{e}}-Hoover chain (NHC) thermostat for a number of physically relevant properties of the liquid water and hydrogen-in-palladium systems. In nearly every case, the new PILE thermostat is found to perform just as well as the NHC thermostat while allowing for a computationally more efficient implementation. The GLE thermostat also proves to be very robust delivering a near-optimum sampling efficiency in all of the cases considered. We suspect that these simple stochastic thermostats will therefore find useful application in many future PIMD simulations.},

This makes dimensionality reduction problematic because the data does not satisfy the assumptions made in conventional manifold learning algorithms We therefore propose that when dimensionality reduction is performed on trajectory data one should think of the resultant embedding as a quickly sketched set of directions rather than a road map. In other words, the embedding tells one about the connectivity between states but does not provide the vectors that correspond to the slow degrees of freedom. This realization informs the development of sketch-map, which endeavors to reproduce the proximity information from the high-dimensionality description in a space of lower dimensionality even when a faithful embedding is not possible.},

Here, we show from an analysis of ab initio simulations that take proper account of nuclear quantum effects that the hydrogen-bonded protons in liquid water experience significant excursions in the direction of the acceptor oxygen atoms. This generates a small but nonnegligible fraction of transient autoprotolysis events that are not seen in simulations with classical nuclei. These events are associated with major rearrangements of the electronic density, as revealed by an analysis of the computed Wannier centers and (1)H chemical shifts. We also show that the quantum fluctuations exhibit significant correlations across neighboring HBs, consistent with an ephemeral shuttling of protons along water wires. We end by suggesting possible implications for our understanding of how perturbations (solvated ions, interfaces, and confinement) might affect the HB network in water.},

As a consequence, all too often the potential energy of the system is used as a proxy, overlooking entropic and anharmonic effects. Here we discuss a combination of different thermodynamic integration routes to obtain the absolute Gibbs free energy of a solid system starting from a harmonic reference state. This approach enables the direct comparison between the free energy of different structures, circumventing the need to sample the transition paths between them. We showcase this thermodynamic integration scheme by computing the Gibbs free energy associated with a vacancy in BCC iron, and the intrinsic stacking fault free energy of nickel. These examples highlight the pitfalls of estimating the free energy of crystallographic defects only using the minimum potential energy, which overestimates the vacancy free energy by 60{\%} and the stacking-fault energy by almost 300{\%} at temperatures close to the melting point.},

Specifically, we consider shrinkage methods which are suitable for high dimensional problems with a small number of samples (large p small n). First, we improve on the Ledoit-Wolf (LW) method by conditioning on a sufficient statistic. By the Rao-Blackwell theorem, this yields a new estimator called RBLW, whose mean-squared error dominates that of LW for Gaussian variables. Second, to further reduce the estimation error, we propose an iterative approach which approximates the clairvoyant shrinkage estimator. Convergence of this iterative method is established and a closed form expression for the limit is determined, which is referred to as the oracle approximating shrinkage (OAS) estimator. Both RBLW and OAS estimators have simple expressions and are easily implemented. Although the two methods are developed from different perspectives, their structure is identical up to specified constants. The RBLW estimator provably dominates the LW method for Gaussian samples. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the OAS approach can perform even better than RBLW, especially when n is much less than p . We also demonstrate the performance of these techniques in the context of adaptive beamforming.},

Barrierless proton transfer is observed in each case when quantum nuclear effects (QNEs) are accounted for. The key difference between the two systems is that in the nanotube facile PT is facilitated by a favorable pre-alignment of water molecules, whereas in bulk liquid water solvent reorganization is required prior to PT. Configurations where the quantum excess proton is delocalized over several adjacent water molecules along with continuous interconversion between different hydration states reveals that, as in liquid water, the hydrated proton under confinement is best described as a fluxional defect, rather than any individual idealized hydration state such as Zundel, Eigen, or the so-called linear H7O3(+) complex along the water chain. These findings highlight the importance of QNEs in intermediate strength hydrogen bonds (HBs) and explain why H(+) diffusion through nanochannels is impeded much less than other cations.},

The properties of the interface between solid and melt are key to solidification and melting, as the interfacial free energy introduces a kinetic barrier to phase transitions. This makes solidification happen below the melting temperature, in out-of-equilibrium conditions at which the interfacial free energy is ill defined. Here we draw a connection between the atomistic description of a diffuse solid-liquid interface and its thermodynamic characterization. This framework resolves the ambiguities in defining the solid-liquid interfacial free energy above and below the melting temperature. In addition, we introduce a simulation protocol that allows solid-liquid interfaces to be reversibly created and destroyed at conditions relevant for experiments. We directly evaluate the value of the interfacial free energy away from the melting point for a simple but realistic atomic potential, and find a more complex temperature dependence than the constant positive slope that has been generally assumed based on phenomenological considerations and that has been used to interpret experiments. This methodology could be easily extended to the study of other phase transitions, from condensation to precipitation. Our analysis can help reconcile the textbook picture of classical nucleation theory with the growing body of atomistic studies and mesoscale models of solidification.},

One of the most prominent consequences of the quantum nature of light atomic nuclei is that their kinetic energy does not follow a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution. Deep inelastic neutron scattering (DINS) experiments can measure this effect. Thus, the nuclear quantum kinetic energy can be probed directly in both ordered and disordered samples. However, the relation between the quantum kinetic energy and the atomic environment is a very indirect one, and cross-validation with theoretical modeling is therefore urgently needed. Here, we use state of the art path integral molecular dynamics techniques to compute the kinetic energy of hydrogen and oxygen nuclei in liquid, solid, and gas-phase water close to the triple point, comparing three different interatomic potentials and validating our results against equilibrium isotope fractionation measurements. We will then show how accurate simulations can draw a link between extremely precise fractionation experiments and DINS, therefore establishing a reliable benchmark for future measurements and providing key insights to increase further the accuracy of interatomic potentials for water.},

We report a multiscale investigation of the bulk and surface of aqueous electrolyte solutions that extends from the atomic scale (using atomistic modeling) to nanoscopic length scales (using bulk and interfacial femtosecond second harmonic measurements) to the macroscopic scale (using surface tension experiments). Electrolytes induce orientational order at concentrations starting at 10 mM that causes nonspecific changes in the surface tension of dilute electrolyte solutions.

We show how the number of solid and liquid atoms in such simulations can be determined unambiguously by using a Gibbs dividing surface and how the free energy as a function of the number of solid atoms in the nucleus can thus be extracted. We then show that the parameters of a model based on classical nucleation theory can be fit using the information contained in these free-energy profiles but that the parameters in such models are highly correlated. This correlation is unfortunate as it ensures that small errors in the computed free energy surface can give rise to large errors in the extrapolated properties of the fitted model. To resolve this problem we thus propose a method for fitting macroscopic nucleation models that uses simulations of planar interfaces and simulations of three-dimensional nuclei in tandem. We show that when the parameters of the macroscopic model are fitted in this way the numerical errors for the final fitted model are smaller and that the extrapolated predictions for large nuclei are thus more reliable.},

We show that the diffusivity of hydrogen in the lattice of BCC iron deviates strongly from an Arrhenius behavior at and below room temperature. We compare a quantum transition state theory to explicit ring polymer molecular dynamics in the calculation of diffusivity and we find that the role of phonons is to inhibit, not to enhance, diffusivity at intermediate temperatures in constrast to the usual polaron picture of hopping. We then address the trapping of hydrogen by a vacancy as a prototype lattice defect. By a sequence of steps in a thought experiment, each involving a thermodynamic integration, we are able to separate out the binding free energy of a proton to a defect into harmonic and anharmonic, and classical and quantum contributions. We find that about 30{\%} of a typical binding free energy of hydrogen to a lattice defect in iron is accounted for by finite temperature effects and about half of these arise from quantum proton fluctuations. This has huge implications for the comparison between thermal desorption and permeation experiments and standard electronic structure theory.

  abstract = {We have used the ring polymer molecular dynamics method to study the Azzouz-Borgis model for proton transfer between phenol (AH) and trimethylamine (B) in liquid methyl chloride. When the A-H distance is used as the reaction coordinate, the ring polymer trajectories are found to exhibit multiple recrossings of the transition state dividing surface and to give a rate coefficient that is smaller than the quantum transition state theory value by an order of magnitude. This is to be expected on kinematic grounds for a heavy-light-heavy reaction when the light atom transfer coordinate is used as the reaction coordinate, and it clearly precludes the use of transition state theory with this reaction coordinate. As has been shown previously for this problem, a solvent polarization coordinate defined in terms of the expectation value of the proton transfer distance in the ground adiabatic quantum state provides a better reaction coordinate with less recrossing. These results are discussed in light of the wide body of earlier theoretical work on the Azzouz-Borgis model and the considerable range of previously reported values for its proton and deuteron transfer rate coefficients.},

Here we exert a similar degree of structural control in synthetic supramolecular elastomers and thus tailor them for a broad range of thermomechanical properties. We show that oligopeptide-terminated polymers selectively self-assemble into small aggregates or nanofibrils, depending on the length of the oligopeptides. This process is self-sorting if differently long oligopeptides are combined so that different nanostructures coexist in bulk mixtures. Blends of polymers with oligopeptides matching in length furnish reinforced elastomers that exhibit shear moduli one order of magnitude higher than the parent polymers. By contrast, novel interpenetrating supramolecular networks that display excellent vibration damping properties are obtained from blends comprising non-matching oligopeptides or unmodified polymers. Hence, blends of oligopeptide-modified polymers constitute a toolbox for tailored elastomers with versatile properties.},

We smooth the classical optimal transportation problem with an entropic regularization term, and show that the resulting optimum is also a distance which can be computed through Sinkhorn-Knopp's matrix scaling algorithm at a speed that is several orders of magnitude faster than that of transportation solvers.

Quantum effects on nuclear motion have been included through a quantum thermal bath (QTB). The interatomic forces were described either within the density functional theory (DFT) in the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) or by the phenomenological approach using the shell model. For both models, the isotopic shift in the lattice parameter can be successfully predicted by QTB-MD simulations. The slope of the experimental isotopic shift in pressure is satisfactorily reproduced by QTB-MD within DFT-GGA, in contrast to both density functional perturbation theory and QTB-MD with the shell model. We have analyzed the reasons for these discrepancies through the vibrational densities of states and the isotopic shifts in bulk modulus. The results illustrate the importance of anharmonic contributions to vibrations and to the isotopic pressure shift between LiH and LiD.},

  abstract = {The definition of reaction coordinates for the characterization of a protein-folding reaction has long been a controversial issue, even for the "simple" case in which one single free-energy barrier separates the folded and unfolded ensemble. We propose a general approach to this problem to obtain a few collective coordinates by using nonlinear dimensionality reduction. We validate the usefulness of this method by characterizing the folding landscape associated with a coarse-grained protein model of src homology 3 as sampled by molecular dynamics simulations. The folding free-energy landscape projected on the few relevant coordinates emerging from the dimensionality reduction can correctly identify the transition-state ensemble of the reaction. The first embedding dimension efficiently captures the evolution of the folding process along the main folding route. These results clearly show that the proposed method can efficiently find a low-dimensional representation of a complex process such as protein folding.},

Lett. 50 1285 (1983), based on density-functional theory, as a new means of calculating ground-state properties of realistic metal systems. We derive an expression for the total energy of a metal using the embedding energy from which we obtain several ground-state properties, such as the lattice constant, elastic constants, sublimation energy, and vacancy-formation energy. We obtain the embedding energy and accompanying pair potentials semiempirically for Ni and Pd, and use these to treat several problems: surface energy and relaxation of the (100), (110), and (111) faces; properties of H in bulk metal (H migration, binding of H to vacancies, and lattice expansion in the hydride phase); binding site and adsorption energy of hydrogen on (100), (110), and (111) surfaces; and lastly, fracture of Ni and the effects of hydrogen on the fracture. We emphasize problems with hydrogen and with surfaces because none of these can be treated with pair potentials. The agreement with experiment, the applicability to practical problems, and the simplicity of the technique make it an effective tool for atomistic studies of defects in metals.},

  abstract  = {We report on the organization and outcome of the fourth blind test of crystal structure prediction, an international collaborative project organized to evaluate the present state in computational methods of predicting the crystal structures of small organic molecules. There were 14 research groups which took part, using a variety of methods to generate and rank the most likely crystal structures for four target systems: three single-component crystal structures and a 1:1 cocrystal. Participants were challenged to predict the crystal structures of the four systems, given only their molecular diagrams, while the recently determined but as-yet unpublished crystal structures were withheld by an independent referee. Three predictions were allowed for each system. The results demonstrate a dramatic improvement in rates of success over previous blind tests; in total, there were 13 successful predictions and, for each of the four targets, at least two groups correctly predicted the observed crystal structure. The successes include one participating group who correctly predicted all four crystal structures as their first ranked choice, albeit at a considerable computational expense. The results reflect important improvements in modelling methods and suggest that, at least for the small and fairly rigid types of molecules included in this blind test, such calculations can be constructively applied to help understand crystallization and polymorphism of organic molecules.},

The large databases of structures and properties that result from compu-tational searches, as well as the agglomeration of data of heterogeneous provenance leads to considerable challenges when it comes to navigating the database, representing its structure at a glance, understanding structure-property relations, eliminat-ing duplicates and identifying inconsistencies. Here we present a case study, based on a data set of conformers of amino acids and dipeptides, of how machine-learning techniques can help addressing these issues. We will exploit a recently-developed strategy to define a metric between structures, and use it as the basis of both clustering and dimensionality reduction tech-niques – showing how these can help reveal structure-property relations, identify outliers and inconsistent structures, and rationalise how perturbations (e.g. binding of ions to the molecule) affect the stability of different conformers.},

  abstract      = {Evaluating the (dis)similarity of crystalline, disordered and molecular compounds is a critical step in the development of algorithms to navigate automatically the configuration space of complex materials. For instance, a structural similarity metric is crucial for classifying structures, searching chemical space for better compounds and materials, and to drive the next generation of machine-learning techniques for predicting the stability and properties of molecules and materials. In the last few years several strategies have been designed to compare atomic coordination environments. In particular, the Smooth Overlap of Atomic Positions (SOAP) has emerged as a natural framework to obtain translation, rotation and permutation-invariant descriptors of groups of atoms, driven by the design of various classes of machine-learned inter-atomic potentials. Here we discuss how one can combine such local descriptors using a Regularized Entropy Match (REMatch) approach to describe the similarity of both whole molecular and bulk periodic structures, introducing powerful metrics that allow the navigation of alchemical and structural complexity within a unified framework. Furthermore, using this kernel and a ridge regression method we can also predict atomization energies for a database of small organic molecules with a mean absolute error below 1 kcal/mol, reaching an important milestone in the application of machine-learning techniques to the evaluation of molecular properties.},

On weakly interacting surfaces, unfolded proteins refold into flat, irregular patches composed of individual molecules.

Based on a machine-learning representation of the density-functional theory (DFT) potential-energy surface, such interatomic potentials enable materials simulations with close-to DFT accuracy but at much lower computational cost. We first determine the maximum accuracy that any finite-range potential can achieve in carbon structures; then, using a novel hierarchical set of two-, three-, and many-body structural descriptors, we construct a GAP model that can indeed reach the target accuracy. The potential yields accurate energetic and structural properties over a wide range of densities; it also correctly captures the structure of the liquid phases, at variance with state-of-the-art empirical potentials. Exemplary applications of the GAP model to surfaces of "diamond-like" tetrahedral amorphous carbon (ta-C) are presented, including an estimate of the amorphous material's surface energy, and simulations of high-temperature surface reconstructions ("graphitization"). The new interatomic potential appears to be promising for realistic and accurate simulations of nanoscale amorphous carbon structures.},

Additionally, we offer detailed accuracy measurements, which shed some light on the influence of several tuning parameters and also show that the existing methods — although similar in spirit — exhibit remarkable differences in accuracy.

  abstract = {Water-metal interfaces are ubiquitous and play a key role in many chemical processes, from catalysis to corrosion. Whereas water adlayers on atomically flat transition metal surfaces have been investigated in depth, little is known about the chemistry of water on stepped surfaces, commonly occurring in realistic situations. Using first-principles simulations, we study the adsorption of water on a stepped platinum surface. We find that water adsorbs preferentially at the step edge, forming linear clusters or chains, stabilized by the cooperative effect of chemical bonds with the substrate and hydrogen bonds. In contrast with their behavior on flat Pt, at steps water molecules dissociate, forming mixed hydroxyl/water structures, through an autocatalytic mechanism promoted by H-bonding. Nuclear quantum effects contribute to stabilize partially dissociated cluster and chains. Together with the recently demonstrated behavior of water chains adsorbed on stepped Pt surfaces to transfer protons via thermally activated hopping, these findings make these systems viable candidates for proton wires.},

  abstract = {We describe a method for recovering the underlying parametrization of scattered data (m(i)) lying on a manifold M embedded in high-dimensional Euclidean space. The method, Hessian-based locally linear embedding, derives from a conceptual framework of local isometry in which the manifold M, viewed as a Riemannian submanifold of the ambient Euclidean Space R(n), is locally isometric to an open, connected subset $\Theta$ of Euclidean space R(d). Because $\Theta$ does not have to be convex, this framework is able to handle a significantly wider class of situations than the original ISOMAP algorithm. The theoretical framework revolves around a quadratic form H(f) = ∫(M)||H(f)(m)||²(F)dm defined on functions f: M--{\textgreater} R. Here Hf denotes the Hessian of f, and H(f) averages the Frobenius norm of the Hessian over M. To define the Hessian, we use orthogonal coordinates on the tangent planes of M. The key observation is that, if M truly is locally isometric to an open, connected subset of R(d), then H(f) has a (d + 1)-dimensional null space consisting of the constant functions and a d-dimensional space of functions spanned by the original isometric coordinates. Hence, the isometric coordinates can be recovered up to a linear isometry. Our method may be viewed as a modification of locally linear embedding and our theoretical framework as a modification of the Laplacian eigenmaps framework, where we substitute a quadratic form based on the Hessian in place of one based on the Laplacian.},

  abstract = {The focus in protein folding has been very much on the protein backbone and sidechains. However, hydration waters make comparable contributions to the structure and energy of proteins. The coupling between fast hydration dynamics and protein dynamics is considered to play an important role in protein folding. Fundamental questions of protein hydration include, how far out into the solvent does the influence of the biomolecule reach, how is the water affected, and how are the properties of the hydration water influenced by the separation between protein molecules in solution? We show here that Terahertz spectroscopy directly probes such solvation dynamics around proteins, and determines the width of the dynamical hydration layer. We also investigate the dependence of solvation dynamics on protein concentration. We observe an unexpected nonmonotonic trend in the measured terahertz absorbance of the five helix bundle protein lambda(6-85)* as a function of the protein: water molar ratio. The trend can be explained by overlapping solvation layers around the proteins. Molecular dynamics simulations indicate water dynamics in the solvation layer around one protein to be distinct from bulk water out to approximately 10 A. At higher protein concentrations such that solvation layers overlap, the calculated absorption spectrum varies nonmonotonically, qualitatively consistent with the experimental observations. The experimental data suggest an influence on the correlated water network motion beyond 20 A, greater than the pure structural correlation length usually observed.},

Its main advantage is in retaining its uniformity with the increased density, providing efficient means for sparse image sampling and display. In contrast to previously presented stochastic approaches, the FPS guarantees the uniformity in a deterministic min-max sense. Within this uniformity criterion, the sampling points are irregularly spaced, exhibiting anti-aliasing properties comparable to those characteristic of the best available method (Poisson disk). A straightforward modification of the FPS yields an image-dependent adaptive sampling scheme. An efficient O(N log N) algorithm for both versions is introduced, and several applications of the FPS are discussed.},

We geometry optimise 74,963 ice structures, which are selected and constructed from over five million tetrahedral networks listed in the databases of Treacy, Deem, and the International Zeolite Association. All prior knowledge of ice is set aside and we introduce "generalised convex hulls" to identify configurations stabilised by appropriate thermodynamic constraints. We thereby rediscover all known phases (I-XVII, i, 0 and the quartz phase) except the metastable ice IV. Crucially, we also find promising candidates for ices XVIII through LI. Using the "sketch-map" dimensionality-reduction algorithm we construct an a priori, navigable map of configuration space, which reproduces similarity relations between structures and highlights the novel candidates. By relating the known phases to the tractably small, yet structurally diverse set of synthesisable candidate structures, we provide an excellent starting point for identifying formation pathways.},

  abstract      = {Harmonic calculations based on density-functional theory are generally the method of choice for the description of phonon spectra of metals and insulators. The inclusion of anharmonic effects is, however, delicate as it relies on perturbation theory requiring a considerable amount of computer time, fast increasing with the cell size. Furthermore, perturbation theory breaks down when the harmonic solution is dynamically unstable or the anharmonic correction of the phonon energies is larger than the harmonic frequencies themselves. We present here a stochastic implementation of the self-consistent harmonic approximation valid to treat anharmonicity at any temperature in the nonperturbative regime. The method is based on the minimization of the free energy with respect to a trial density matrix described by an arbitrary harmonic Hamiltonian. The minimization is performed with respect to all the free parameters in the trial harmonic Hamiltonian, namely, equilibrium positions, phonon frequencies, and polarization vectors. The gradient of the free energy is calculated following a stochastic procedure. The method can be used to calculate thermodynamic properties, dynamical properties, and even anharmonic corrections to the Eliashberg function of the electron-phonon coupling. The scaling with the system size is greatly improved with respect to perturbation theory. The validity of the method is demonstrated in the strongly anharmonic palladium and platinum hydrides. In both cases, we predict a strong anharmonic correction to the harmonic phonon spectra, far beyond the perturbative limit. In palladium hydrides, we calculate thermodynamic properties beyond the quasiharmonic approximation, while in PtH, we demonstrate that the high superconducting critical temperatures at 100 GPa predicted in previous calculations based on the harmonic approximation are strongly suppressed when anharmonic effects are included.},

  abstract      = {The quantum nature of the proton can crucially affect the structural and physical properties of hydrogen compounds. For example, in the high-pressure phases of H2O, quantum proton fluctuations lead to symmetrization of the hydrogen bond and reduce the boundary between asymmetric and symmetric structures in the phase diagram by 30 gigapascals (ref. 3). Here we show that an analogous quantum symmetrization occurs in the recently discovered sulfur hydride superconductor with a superconducting transition temperature Tc of 203 kelvin at 155 gigapascals-the highest Tc reported for any superconductor so far. Superconductivity occurs via the formation of a compound with chemical formula H3S (sulfur trihydride) with sulfur atoms arranged on a body-centred cubic lattice. If the hydrogen atoms are treated as classical particles, then for pressures greater than about 175 gigapascals they are predicted to sit exactly halfway between two sulfur atoms in a structure with symmetry. At lower pressures, the hydrogen atoms move to an off-centre position, forming a short H-S covalent bond and a longer H{\textperiodcentered}{\textperiodcentered}{\textperiodcentered}S hydrogen bond in a structure with R3m symmetry. X-ray diffraction experiments confirm the H3S stoichiometry and the sulfur lattice sites, but were unable to discriminate between the two phases. Ab initio density-functional-theory calculations show that quantum nuclear motion lowers the symmetrization pressure by 72 gigapascals for H3S and by 60 gigapascals for D3S. Consequently, we predict that the phase dominates the pressure range within which the high Tc was measured. The observed pressure dependence of Tc is accurately reproduced in our calculations for the phase, but not for the R3m phase. Therefore, the quantum nature of the proton fundamentally changes the superconducting phase diagram of H3S.},

The representation is based on Gaussian distribution functions, scaled by power laws and explicitly accounting for structural as well as elemental degrees of freedom. The elemental components help us to lower the QML model's learning curve, and, through interpolation across the periodic table, even enable “alchemical extrapolation” to covalent bonding between elements not part of training. This point is demonstrated for the prediction of covalent binding in single, double, and triple bonds among main-group elements as well as for atomization energies in organic molecules. We present numerical evidence that resulting QML energy models, after training on a few thousand random training instances, reach chemical accuracy for out-of-sample compounds. Compound dat...},

The edge dislocation of the 1/2[1¯10](111) type is observed to dissociate into two partials separating from each other by a distance of 9 {\AA}. The half width of the two partial dislocations is deduced to be 6.5 {\AA}, giving a half width of the whole dislocation of 12 {\AA}. Dislocation mobility is studied by applying a shear stress on the crystal and by observing the corresponding shift of the Burgers vector density. After considering the mirror force on the dislocation exerted by the fixed boundaries, a Peierls stress of 0.75×10-4$\mu$ ($\mu$ is the shear modulus) for the motion of the whole dislocation is obtained. Atomic diffusion in the core region of the edge dislocation is simulated by hyper molecular dynamics method and the migration energy for vacancy diffusing in the dislocation core is calculated to approximate 0.5 eV.},

In the case of C8 we find the dynamics to be governed by torsional motions. For C16 and C24 we extract three global order parameters with which we characterize the fundamental dynamics, and determine that the low free-energy pathway of globular collapse proceeds by a "kink and slide" mechanism, whereby a bend near the end of the linear chain migrates toward the middle to form a hairpin and, ultimately, a coiled helix. The low-dimensional representation is subtly perturbed in the solvated phase relative to the ideal gas, and its geometric structure is conserved between C16 and C24. The methodology is directly extensible to biomolecular self-assembly processes, such as protein folding.},

As would be expected for a thermally activated unlocking of the stabilizing "interstitial," the transition from VHDA to LDA (low-density amorphous ice) is very sharp. Although its higher density makes VHDA a better candidate than HDA for a physical manifestation of the second putative liquid phase of water, as for the HDA case, the VHDA to LDA transition also appears to be kinetically controlled.},

The observed excess of proton mean kinetic energy, with respect to theoretical predictions and measurements in water stable liquid and solid phases, suggested a possible link between the anomalous temperature dependence of water density and the temperature dependence of {\textless}E(k){\textgreater}. Nevertheless, the limited number of data did not allow a more quantitative description. Here we report on new measurements, above and below the temperature of maximum density and in the supercooled phase. These show two {\textless}E(k){\textgreater} maxima: The first one, in the supercooled phase in the range of 269-272 K, and a second one at 277 K, the temperature of the maximum density of water.},

This technique is used extensively in fields ranging from physics to genetics and economics. The rejection of trial configurations is a central ingredient in existing Markov chain Monte Carlo simulations. I argue that the efficiency of Monte Carlo simulations can be enhanced, sometimes dramatically, by properly sampling configurations that are normally rejected. This "waste-recycling" of microstates is useful in sampling schemes in which only one of a large set of trial configurations is accepted. It differs fundamentally from schemes that extract information about the density of macrostates from virtual Monte Carlo moves. As a simple illustration, I show that the method greatly improves the calculation of the order-parameter distribution of a two-dimensional Ising model. This method should enhance the efficiency of parallel Monte Carlo simulations significantly.},

Our approach strongly simplifies the analysis of large trajectories and it opens the way to the construction of kinetic network models of activated processes in solution employing the available efficient schemes developed for proteins conformational ensembles.},

  abstract      = {Molecules like water have vibrational modes with a zero-point energy well above room temperature. As a consequence, classical molecular dynamics simulations of their liquids largely underestimate the energy of modes with a higher zero-point temperature, which translates into an underestimation of covalent interatomic distances due to anharmonic effects. Zero-point effects can be recovered using path integral molecular dynamics simulations, but these are computationally expensive, making their combination with ab initio molecular dynamics simulations a challenge. As an alternative to path integral methods, from a computationally simple perspective, one would envision the design of a thermostat capable of equilibrating and maintaining the different vibrational modes at their corresponding zero-point temperatures. Recently, Ceriotti et al. [ Phys. Rev. Lett. 102 020601 (2009)] introduced a framework to use a custom-tailored Langevin equation with correlated noise that can be used to include quantum fluctuations in classical molecular dynamics simulations. Here we show that it is possible to use the generalized Langevin equation with suppressed noise in combination with Nose-Hoover thermostats to efficiently impose a zero-point temperature on independent modes in liquid water. Using our simple and inexpensive method, we achieve excellent agreement for all atomic pair correlation functions compared to the path integral molecular dynamics simulation.},

  abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2014 AIP Publishing LLC. The concept of chemical bonding can ultimately be seen as a rationalization of the recurring structural patterns observed in molecules and solids. Chemical intuition is nothing but the ability to recognize and predict such patterns, and how they transform into one another. Here, we discuss how to use a computer to identify atomic patterns automatically, so as to provide an algorithmic definition of a bond based solely on structural information. We concentrate in particular on hydrogen bonding - a central concept to our understanding of the physical chemistry of water, biological systems, and many technologically important materials. Since the hydrogen bond is a somewhat fuzzy entity that covers a broad range of energies and distances, many different criteria have been proposed and used over the years, based either on sophisticate electronic structure calculations followed by an energy decomposition analysis, or on somewhat arbitrary choices of a range of structural parameters that is deemed to correspond to a hydrogen-bonded configuration. We introduce here a definition that is univocal, unbiased, and adaptive, based on our machine-learning analysis of an atomistic simulation. The strategy we propose could be easily adapted to similar scenarios, where one has to recognize or classify structural patterns in a material or chemical compound.},

  abstract      = {{\textcopyright} 2016 American Chemical Society. The hydrogen-bond network of water is characterized by the presence of coordination defects relative to the ideal tetrahedral network of ice, whose fluctuations determine the static and time-dependent properties of the liquid. Because of topological constraints, such defects do not come alone but are highly correlated coming in a plethora of different pairs. Here we discuss in detail such correlations in the case of ab initio water models and show that they have interesting similarities to regular and defective solid phases of water. Although defect correlations involve deviations from idealized tetrahedrality, they can still be regarded as weaker hydrogen bonds that retain a high degree of directionality. We also investigate how the structure and population of coordination defects is affected by approximations to the interatomic potential, finding that, in most cases, the qualitative features of the hydrogen-bond network are remarkably robust.},

  abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 American Chemical Society. Most of the current understanding of structure-property relations at the molecular and the supramolecular scales can be formulated in terms of the stability of and the interactions between a limited number of recurring structural motifs (e.g., H-bonds, coordination polyhedra, and protein secondary structure). Here we demonstrate an algorithm to automatically recognize such patterns, based on the identification of local maxima in the probability distributions observed in atomistic computer simulations, which is robust to the dimensionality and the sparsity of the reference atomistic data. We first discuss its main features, demonstrating some on artificial data sets, and then show how it can be applied to identify coordination environments in Lennard-Jones clusters and to recognize secondary-structure patterns in the simulation of an oligopeptide. To assess the applicability of this algorithm for motifs that involve several interdependent degrees of freedom, we also employ it to identify groups of conformers of the cluster and the polypeptide, considered in their entirety. The motifs identified by analyzing atomistic simulations can be used to interpret and rationalize the stability and behavior of the system at hand, and also as a tool to accelerate sampling, in association with biased molecular dynamics schemes.},

Because of the short time scales and microscopic length scales involved, the dynamics of this autoionization have not been directly probed by experiment. Here, the autoionization mechanism is revealed by sampling and analyzing ab initio molecular dynamics trajectories. We identify the rare fluctuations in solvation energies that destabilize an oxygen-hydrogen bond. Through the transfer of protons along a hydrogen bond "wire," the nascent ions separate by three or more neighbors. If the hydrogen bond wire connecting the two ions is subsequently broken, a metastable charge-separated state is visited. The ions may then diffuse to large separations. If, however, the hydrogen bond wire remains unbroken, the ions recombine rapidly. Because of their concomitant large electric fields, the transient ionic species produced in this case may provide an experimentally detectable signal of the dynamics we report.},

The hydronium ion is known to be a weak acceptor of a hydrogen bond which gives it some hydrophobic character. Quantum effects reduce the degree of this hydrophobicity which facilitates the fluctuations of the protons along the wires compared to the classical proton. Although the Eigen and Zundel species still appear to be dominant motifs, quantum fluctuations result in rather drastic events where both transient autoionization and delocalization over extended proton wires can simultaneously occur. These wild fluctuations also result in a significant change of the electronic properties of the system such as the broadening of the electronic density of states. An analysis of the Wannier functions indicate that quantum fluctuations of neat water molecules result in transient charging with subtle similarities and differences to that of the excess proton.},

Recent work has stressed the importance of DFT errors in describing dispersion, but we note that errors in other parts of the energy may also contribute. We obtain information about the nature of DFT errors by using a many-body separation of the total energy into its 1-body, 2-body, and beyond-2-body components to analyze the deficiencies of the popular PBE and BLYP approximations for the energetics of water clusters and ice structures. The errors of these approximations are computed by using accurate benchmark energies from the coupled-cluster technique of molecular quantum chemistry and from quantum Monte Carlo calculations. The systems studied are isomers of the water hexamer cluster, the crystal structures Ih, II, XV, and VIII of ice, and two clusters extracted from ice VIII. For the binding energies of these systems, we use the machine-learning technique of Gaussian Approximation Potentials to correct successively for 1-body and 2-body errors of the DFT approximations. We find that even after correction for these errors, substantial beyond-2-body errors remain. The characteristics of the 2-body and beyond-2-body errors of PBE are completely different from those of BLYP, but the errors of both approximations disfavor the close approach of non-hydrogen-bonded monomers. We note the possible relevance of our findings to the understanding of liquid water.},

Early stages of precipitation are particularly important from the fundamental and technological side, but are still far from being fully understood. Here, an analysis of the energetics of nanometric precipitates of the meta-stable $\beta$″ phases is performed, identifying the bulk, elastic strain and interface energies that contribute to the stability of a nucleating cluster. Results show that needle-shape precipitates are unstable to growth even at the smallest size $\beta$″ formula unit, i.e. there is no energy barrier to growth. The small differences between different compositions points toward the need for the study of possible precipitate/matrix interface reconstruction. A classical semi-quantitative nucleation theory approach including elastic strain energy captures the trends in precipitate energy versus size and composition. This validates the use of mesoscale models to assess stability and interactions of precipitates. Studies of smaller 3D clusters also show stability relative to the solid solution state, indicating that the early stages of precipitation may be diffusion-limited. Overall, these results demonstrate the important interplay among composition-dependent bulk, interface, and elastic strain energies in determining nanoscale precipitate stability and growth.},

  abstract      = {The paper proposes Metropolis adjusted Langevin and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling methods defined on the Riemann manifold to resolve the shortcomings of existing Monte Carlo algorithms when sampling from target densities that may be high dimensional and exhibit strong correlations. The methods provide fully automated adaptation mechanisms that circumvent the costly pilot runs that are required to tune proposal densities for Metropolis-Hastings or indeed Hamiltonian Monte Carlo and Metropolis adjusted Langevin algorithms. This allows for highly efficient sampling even in very high dimensions where different scalings may be required for the transient and stationary phases of the Markov chain. The methodology proposed exploits the Riemann geometry of the parameter space of statistical models and thus automatically adapts to the local structure when simulating paths across this manifold, providing highly efficient convergence and exploration of the target density. The performance of these Riemann manifold Monte Carlo methods is rigorously assessed by performing inference on logistic regression models, log-Gaussian Cox point processes, stochastic volatility models and Bayesian estimation of dynamic systems described by non-linear differential equations. Substantial improvements in the time-normalized effective sample size are reported when compared with alternative sampling approaches. MATLAB code that is available from http://www.ucl.ac.uk/statistics/research/rmhmc allows replication of all the results reported.},

  abstract      = {We present a novel scheme to accurately predict atomic forces as vector quantities, rather than sets of scalar components, by Gaussian Process (GP) Regression. This is based on matrix-valued kernel functions, on which we impose the requirements that the predicted force rotates with the target configuration and is independent of any rotations applied to the configuration database entries. We show that such covariant GP kernels can be obtained by integration over the elements of the rotation group SO(d) for the relevant dimensionality d. Remarkably, in specific cases the integration can be carried out analytically and yields a conservative force field that can be recast into a pair interaction form. Finally, we show that restricting the integration to a summation over the elements of a finite point group relevant to the target system is sufficient to recover an accurate GP. The accuracy of our kernels in predicting quantum-mechanical forces in real materials is investigated by tests on pure and defective Ni, Fe and Si crystalline systems.},

We furthermore describe how the {\$}n{\$}-body kernels can be "mapped" on equivalent representations that provide database-size-independent predictions and are thus crucially more efficient. We explicitly carry out this mapping procedure for the first non-trivial (3-body) kernel of the series, and show that this reproduces the GP-predicted forces with {\$}\backslashtext{\{}meV/\backslashAA{\}}{\$} accuracy while being orders of magnitude faster.

  abstract = {When BaZrO(3) is doped with Y in 12.5{\%} of Zr sites, density functional theory with the PBE functional predicts octahedral distortions within a cubic phase yielding a greater variety of proton binding sites than undoped BaZrO(3). Proton binding sites, transition states, and normal modes are found and used to calculate transition state theory rate constants. The binding sites are used to represent vertices in a graph. The rate constants connecting binding sites are used to provide weights for graph edges. Vertex and color coding are used to find proton conduction pathways in BaZr(0.875)Y(0.125)O(3). Many similarly probable proton conduction pathways which can be periodically replicated to yield long range proton conduction are found. The average limiting barriers at 600 K for seven step and eight step periodic pathways are 0.29 and 0.30 eV, respectively. Inclusion of a lattice reorganization barrier raises these to 0.42 and 0.33 eV, respectively. The majority of the seven step pathways have an interoctahedral rate limiting step while the majority of the eight step pathways have an intraoctahedral rate limiting step. While the average limiting barrier of the seven step periodic pathway including a lattice reorganization barrier is closer to experiment, how to appropriately weight different length periodic pathways is not clear. Likely, conduction is influenced by combinations of different length pathways. Vertex and color coding provide useful ways of finding the wide variety of long range proton conduction pathways that contribute to long range proton conduction. They complement more traditional serial methods such as molecular dynamics and kinetic Monte Carlo.},

The idea was to add intramolecular degrees of freedom to the successful rigid model TIP4P/2005 in order to try to improve the predictions for some properties, and to enable the calculation of new ones. The new model incorporates flexibility by means of a Morse potential for the bond stretching and a harmonic term for the angle bending. The parameters have been fitted to account for the peaks of the infrared spectrum of liquid water and to produce an averaged geometry close to that of TIP4P/2005. As for the intermolecular interactions, only a small change in the $\sigma$ parameter of the Lennard-Jones potential has been introduced. The overall predictions are very close to those of TIP4P/2005. This ensures that the new model may be used with the same confidence as its predecessor in studies where a flexible model is advisable.},

We present a new fast kernel function which maps unordered feature sets to multi-resolution histograms and computes a weighted histogram intersection in this space. This "pyramid match" computation is linear in the number of features, and it implicitly finds correspondences based on the finest resolution histogram cell where a matched pair first appears. Since the kernel does not penalize the presence of extra features, it is robust to clutter. We show the kernel function is positive-definite, making it valid for use in learning algorithms whose optimal solutions are guaranteed only for Mercer kernels. We demonstrate our algorithm on object recognition tasks and show it to be accurate and dramatically faster than current approaches},

The activity of over 700 binary surface alloys is evaluated theoretically; the stability of each alloy in electrochemical environments is also estimated. BiPt is found to have a predicted activity comparable to, or even better than, pure Pt, the archetypical HER catalyst.

  abstract = {The method of dispersion correction as an add-on to standard Kohn-Sham density functional theory (DFT-D) has been refined regarding higher accuracy, broader range of applicability, and less empiricism. The main new ingredients are atom-pairwise specific dispersion coefficients and cutoff radii that are both computed from first principles. The coefficients for new eighth-order dispersion terms are computed using established recursion relations. System (geometry) dependent information is used for the first time in a DFT-D type approach by employing the new concept of fractional coordination numbers (CN). They are used to interpolate between dispersion coefficients of atoms in different chemical environments. The method only requires adjustment of two global parameters for each density functional, is asymptotically exact for a gas of weakly interacting neutral atoms, and easily allows the computation of atomic forces. Three-body nonadditivity terms are considered. The method has been assessed on standard benchmark sets for inter- and intramolecular noncovalent interactions with a particular emphasis on a consistent description of light and heavy element systems. The mean absolute deviations for the S22 benchmark set of noncovalent interactions for 11 standard density functionals decrease by 15{\%}-40{\%} compared to the previous (already accurate) DFT-D version. Spectacular improvements are found for a tripeptide-folding model and all tested metallic systems. The rectification of the long-range behavior and the use of more accurate C(6) coefficients also lead to a much better description of large (infinite) systems as shown for graphene sheets and the adsorption of benzene on an Ag(111) surface. For graphene it is found that the inclusion of three-body terms substantially (by about 10{\%}) weakens the interlayer binding. We propose the revised DFT-D method as a general tool for the computation of the dispersion energy in molecules and solids of any kind with DFT and related (low-cost) electronic structure methods for large systems.},

The accuracy and transferability of these models are increased significantly by encoding into the learning procedure the fundamental symmetries of rotational and permutational invariance of scalar properties. However, the prediction of tensorial properties requires that the model respects the appropriate geometric transformations, rather than invariance, when the reference frame is rotated. We introduce a formalism that can be used to perform machine-learning of tensorial properties of arbitrary rank for general molecular geometries. To demonstrate it, we derive a tensor kernel adapted to rotational symmetry, which is the natural generalization of the smooth overlap of atomic positions (SOAP) kernel commonly used for the prediction of scalar properties at the atomic scale. The performance and generality of the approach is demonstrated by learning the instantaneous electrical response of water oligomers of increasing complexity, from the isolated molecule to the condensed phase.},

  abstract = {A charge perturbation variant of the finite-field method has been used to calculate dipole and quadrupole moments, dipole polarizability, hyper- and principal components of high-order polarizabilities of the water molecule in gas and in liquid phase conditions. Calculations were performed for the ground-state water molecule at the MP2 and MP4 levels of theory. The gas phase values determined allow our methodology for extracting polarizabilities to be tested and a properly balanced, moderate-sized basis set to be selected; the results obtained are in very good agreement with experiment and the most accurate previous theoretical estimates. A local field approach is introduced to mimic the electrostatic environment experienced by a water molecule in the liquid. Within this approach, sets of fixed charges are used to generate the desired electric fields and field gradients. Three different liquid phase models and the corresponding sets of electrical properties are examined. The values obtained from these models and for gas-phase are compared. The magnitudes of the dipole and the quadrupole moments increase moving from gas to liquid phase, where the latter shows greater sensitivity to the choice of liquid model. For a liquid phase water molecule the first hyperpolarizability (beta) and first higher polarizability (A) increase markedly, actually changing sign, the second hyperpolarizability (gamma) also increases but much less dramatically, and components of the second high-order polarizability tensor (B) demonstrate a rearrangement of contributions. The values reported for the hyper- and high-order polarizability tensors are the first such theoretical estimates for liquid water.},

We demonstrate that our implementation, which is available as part of the CP2K/Quickstep program, is robust and efficient. Several prescreening techniques lead to a linear scaling cost for integral evaluation and storage. Integral compression techniques allow for in-core calculations on systems containing several thousand basis functions. The massively parallel implementation respects integral symmetry and scales up to hundreds of CPUs using a dynamic load balancing scheme. A time-reversible multiple time step scheme, exploiting the difference in computational efficiency between hybrid and local functionals, brings further time savings. With extensive simulations of liquid water, we demonstrate the ability to perform, for several tens of picoseconds, ab initio molecular dynamics based on hybrid functionals of systems in the condensed phase containing a few thousand Gaussian basis functions.},

We show that thermodynamic integration from the fully-interacting solid of interest to a Debye crystal reference state, with anisotropic harmonic interactions derived from the Hessian of the original crystal, provides a straightforward route to calculating the Gibbs free energy of the solid. To calculate the molecular liquid free energy, it is essential to correctly account for contributions from both intermolecular and intramolecular motion; we employ thermodynamic integration to a Lennard-Jones reference fluid, coupled with direct evaluation of the molecular ro-vibrational partition function. These approaches are used to study the low-pressure classical phase diagram of the flexible q-TIP4P/F water model. We find that, while the experimental ice-I/liquid and ice-III/liquid coexistence lines are described reasonably well by this model, the ice-II phase is predicted to be metastable. In light of this finding, we go on to examine how the coupling between intramolecular flexibility and intermolecular interactions influences the computed phase diagram by comparing our results with those of the underlying rigid-body water model.},

  abstract = {The maximum entropy analytic continuation (MEAC) and ring polymer molecular dynamics (RPMD) methods provide complementary approaches to the calculation of real time quantum correlation functions. RPMD becomes exact in the high temperature limit, where the thermal time betavariant Planck's over 2pi tends to zero and the ring polymer collapses to a single classical bead. MEAC becomes most reliable at low temperatures, where betavariant Planck's over 2pi exceeds the correlation time of interest and the numerical imaginary time correlation function contains essentially all of the information that is needed to recover the real time dynamics. We show here that this situation can be exploited by combining the two methods to give an improved approximation that is better than either of its parts. In particular, the MEAC method provides an ideal way to impose exact moment (or sum rule) constraints on a prior RPMD spectrum. The resulting scheme is shown to provide a practical solution to the "nonlinear operator problem" of RPMD, and to give good agreement with recent exact results for the short-time velocity autocorrelation function of liquid parahydrogen. Moreover these improvements are obtained with little extra effort, because the imaginary time correlation function that is used in the MEAC procedure can be computed at the same time as the RPMD approximation to the real time correlation function. However, there are still some problems involving long-time dynamics for which the RPMD+MEAC combination is inadequate, as we illustrate with an example application to the collective density fluctuations in liquid orthodeuterium.},

  abstract = {Numerous studies have identified large quantum mechanical effects in the dynamics of liquid water. In this paper, we suggest that these effects may have been overestimated due to the use of rigid water models and flexible models in which the intramolecular interactions were described using simple harmonic functions. To demonstrate this, we introduce a new simple point charge model for liquid water, q-TIP4P/F, in which the O-H stretches are described by Morse-type functions. We have parametrized this model to give the correct liquid structure, diffusion coefficient, and infrared absorption frequencies in quantum (path integral-based) simulations. The model also reproduces the experimental temperature variation of the liquid density and affords reasonable agreement with the experimental melting temperature of hexagonal ice at atmospheric pressure. By comparing classical and quantum simulations of the liquid, we find that quantum mechanical fluctuations increase the rates of translational diffusion and orientational relaxation in our model by a factor of around 1.15. This effect is much smaller than that observed in all previous simulations of empirical water models, which have found a quantum effect of at least 1.4 regardless of the quantum simulation method or the water model employed. The small quantum effect in our model is a result of two competing phenomena. Intermolecular zero point energy and tunneling effects destabilize the hydrogen-bonding network, leading to a less viscous liquid with a larger diffusion coefficient. However, this is offset by intramolecular zero point motion, which changes the average water monomer geometry resulting in a larger dipole moment, stronger intermolecular interactions, and a slower diffusion. We end by suggesting, on the basis of simulations of other potential energy models, that the small quantum effect we find in the diffusion coefficient is associated with the ability of our model to produce a single broad O-H stretching band in the infrared absorption spectrum.},

The usual implementation of the REM is performed on local computer clusters (or parallel processors) where the different replicas must be run synchronously. Here, we present serial replica exchange (SREM), a method that is equivalent to the standard REM in terms of efficiency yet runs asynchronously on a distributed network of computers. A second advantage is the method's greatly enhanced fault tolerance, which enables the study of biological systems on worldwide distributed computing environments, such as Folding@Home. For proof of concept, we apply the SREM to a single alanine dipeptide molecule in explicit water. We show that the SREM reproduces the thermodynamic and structural properties determined by the REM.},

These easily implemented estimators are formed by coupling the nominal and perturbed dynamics appearing in the finite difference through a common driving noise, or common random path. After developing a general framework for variance reduction via coupling, we demonstrate the optimality of the common random path coupling in the sense that it produces a minimal variance surrogate for the difference estimator relative to sampling dynamics driven by independent paths. In order to build intuition for the common random path coupling, we evaluate the efficiency of the proposed estimators for a comprehensive set of examples of interest in particle dynamics. These reduced variance difference estimators are also a useful tool for performing global sensitivity analysis and for investigating non-local perturbations of parameters, such as increasing the number of Prony modes active in an extended variable GLE.},

The comparison of transformed binomial or Poisson data with percentage points of the normal distribution to make approximate significance tests or to set approximate confidence intervals is less familiar. Mosteller and Tukey 6 have recently made a graphical application of a transformation related to the square-root transformation for such purposes, where the use of "binomial probability paper" avoids all computation. We report here on an empirical study of a number of approximations, some intended for significance and confidence work and others for variance stabilization. For significance testing and the setting of confidence limits, we should like to use the normal deviate K exceeded with the same probability as the number of successes x from n in a binomial distribution with expectation np, which is defined by frac12pi int{\^{}}K-infty e{\^{}}-frac12t{\^{}}2 dt = operatornameProb x leq k mid operatornamebinomial, n, p.

The similarity of Earth's bulk composition to that of meteorites known as enstatite chondrites suggests a dry proto-Earth with subsequent delivery of volatiles by local accretion or impacts of asteroids or comets. Previous measurements in six comets from the Oort cloud yielded a mean D/H ratio of (2.96 ± 0.25) × 10(-4). The D/H value in carbonaceous chondrites, (1.4 ± 0.1) × 10(-4), together with dynamical simulations, led to models in which asteroids were the main source of Earth's water, with ≤10 per cent being delivered by comets. Here we report that the D/H ratio in the Jupiter-family comet 103P/Hartley 2, which originated in the Kuiper belt, is (1.61 ± 0.24) × 10(-4). This result substantially expands the reservoir of Earth ocean-like water to include some comets, and is consistent with the emerging picture of a complex dynamical evolution of the early Solar System.},

We elucidate the mechanism of recombination in liquid water with ab initio molecular dynamics simulations, and it emerges as quite different from the conventional view of the Grotthuss mechanism. The neutralization event involves a collective compression of the water-wire bridging the ions, which occurs in approximately 0.5 ps, triggering a concerted triple jump of the protons. This process leaves the neutralized hydroxide in a hypercoordinated state, with the implications that enhanced collective compressions of several water molecules around similarly hypercoordinated states are likely to serve as nucleation events for the autoionization of liquid water.},

We demonstrate that NQE significantly alter the phase space properties of the proton and that the local electronic structure of the proton is an exquisitely sensitive indicator of the limiting state in each of the crystals. We evaluate both the proton momentum distribution and the proton chemical shifts and demonstrate that deep inelastic neutron scattering and solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance experiments can serve as complementary techniques for probing the quantum nature of the proton in hydrogen-bonding systems.

  abstract = {The diffusion of protons through water is understood within the framework of the Grotthuss mechanism, which requires that they undergo structural diffusion in a stepwise manner throughout the water network. Despite long study, this picture oversimplifies and neglects the complexity of the supramolecular structure of water. We use first-principles simulations and demonstrate that the currently accepted picture of proton diffusion is in need of revision. We show that proton and hydroxide diffusion occurs through periods of intense activity involving concerted proton hopping followed by periods of rest. The picture that emerges is that proton transfer is a multiscale and multidynamical process involving a broader distribution of pathways and timescales than currently assumed. To rationalize these phenomena, we look at the 3D water network as a distribution of closed directed rings, which reveals the presence of medium-range directional correlations in the liquid. One of the natural consequences of this feature is that both the hydronium and hydroxide ion are decorated with proton wires. These wires serve as conduits for long proton jumps over several hydrogen bonds.},

  abstract = {The mono-, di-, and tetrahydrates of trifluoromethanesulfonic acid, which contain characteristic H(3)O(+), H(5)O(2)(+), and H(9)O(4)(+) structures, provide model systems for understanding proton transport in materials with high perfluorosulfonic acid density such as perfluorosulfonic acid membranes commonly employed in hydrogen fuel cells. Ab initio molecular dynamics simulations indicate that protons in these solids are predisposed to transfer to the water most strongly bound to sulfonate groups via a Grotthuss-type mechanism, but quickly return to the most solvated defect structure either due to the lack of a nearby species to stabilize the new defect or a preference for the proton to be maximally hydrated. Path integral molecular dynamics of the mono- and dihydrate reveal significant quantum effects that facilitate proton transfer to the "presolvated" water or SO(3)(-) in the first solvation shell and increase the Zundel character of all the defects. These trends are quantified in free energy profiles for each bonding environment. Hydrogen bonding criteria for HOH-OH(2) and HOH-O(3)S are extracted from the two-dimensional potential of mean force. The quantum radial distribution function, radius of gyration, and root-mean-square displacement position correlation function show that the protonic charge is distributed over two or more water molecules. Metastable structural defects with one excess proton shared between two sulfonate groups and another Zundel or Eigen type cation defect are found for the mono- and dihydrate but not for the tetrahydrate crystal. Results for the tetrahydrate native crystal exhibit minor differences at 210 and 250 K. IR spectra are calculated for all native and stable defect structures. Graph theory techniques are used to characterize the chain lengths and ring sizes in the hydrogen bond network. Low conductivities when limited water is present may be attributable to trapping of protons between SO(3)(-) groups and the increased probability that protons transfer to waters bridging two different sulfonate groups.},

  abstract = {Surprisingly, there exists a quantum flux-side time-correlation function which has a non-zero t → 0+ limit and thus yields a rigorous quantum generalization of classical transition-state theory (TST). In this Part I of two articles, we introduce the new time-correlation function and derive its t → 0+ limit. The new ingredient is a generalized Kubo transform which allows the flux and side dividing surfaces to be the same function of path-integral space. Choosing this function to be a single point gives a t → 0+ limit which is identical to an expression introduced on heuristic grounds by Wigner in 1932; however, this expression does not give positive-definite quantum statistics, causing it to fail while still in the shallow-tunnelling regime. Positive-definite quantum statistics is obtained only if the dividing surface is invariant to imaginary-time translation, in which case the t → 0+ limit is identical to ring-polymer molecular dynamics (RPMD) TST. The RPMD-TST rate is not a strict upper bound to the exact quantum rate, but is a good approximation to one if real-time coherence effects are small. Part II will show that the RPMD-TST rate is equal to the exact quantum rate in the absence of recrossing.},

  abstract  = {We show that a single change in the derivation of the linearized semiclassical-initial value representation (LSC-IVR or “classical Wigner approximation”) results in a classical dynamics which conserves the quantum Boltzmann distribution. We rederive the (standard) LSC-IVR approach by writing the (exact) quantum time-correlation function in terms of the normal modes of a free ring-polymer (i.e., a discrete imaginary-time Feynman path), taking the limit that the number of polymer beads N → ∞, such that the lowest normal-mode frequencies take their “Matsubara” values. The change we propose is to truncate the quantum Liouvillian, not explicitly in powers of ħ2 at ħ0 (which gives back the standard LSC-IVR approximation), but in the normal-mode derivatives corresponding to the lowest Matsubara frequencies. The resulting “Matsubara” dynamics is inherently classical (since all terms O ( ħ 2 ) disappear from the Matsubara Liouvillian in the limit N → ∞) and conserves the quantum Boltzmann distribution because the Matsubara Hamiltonian is symmetric with respect to imaginary-time translation. Numerical tests show that the Matsubara approximation to the quantum time-correlation function converges with respect to the number of modes and gives better agreement than LSC-IVR with the exact quantum result. Matsubara dynamics is too computationally expensive to be applied to complex systems, but its further approximation may lead to practical methods.},

  abstract = {A definition that equates a hydrogen bond topologically with a local energy well in the potential energy surface is used to study the structure and dynamics of liquid water. We demonstrate the robustness of this hydrogen-bond definition versus the many other definitions which use fixed, arbitrary parameters, do not account for variable molecular environments, and cannot effectively resolve transition states. Our topology definition unambiguously shows that most water molecules are double acceptors but sizable proportions are single or triple acceptors. Almost all hydrogens are found to take part in hydrogen bonds. Broken hydrogen bonds only form when two molecules try to form two hydrogen bonds between them. The double acceptors have tetrahedral geometry, lower potential energy, entropy, and density, and slower dynamics. The single and triple acceptors have trigonal and trigonal bipyramidal geometry and when considered together have higher density, potential energy, and entropy, faster dynamics, and a tendency to cluster. These calculations use an extended theory for the entropy of liquid water that takes into account the variable number of hydrogen bonds. Hydrogen-bond switching is shown to depend explicitly on the variable number of hydrogen bonds accepted and the presence of interstitial water molecules. Transition state theory indicates that the switching of hydrogen bonds is a mildly activated process, requiring only a moderate distortion of hydrogen bonds. Three main types of switching events are observed depending on whether the donor and acceptor are already sharing a hydrogen bond. The switch may proceed with no intermediate or via a bifurcated-oxygen or cyclic dimer, both of which have a broken hydrogen bond and symmetric and asymmetric forms. Switching is found to be strongly coupled to whole-molecule vibration, particularly for the more mobile single and triple acceptors. Our analysis suggests that even though water is heterogeneous in terms of the number of hydrogen bonds, the coupling between neighbors on various length and time scales brings about greater continuity in its properties.},

Several different methods are reviewed and their efficiency compared on a test problem involving conformational transitions in an island of adatoms on a crystal surface. The focus is entirely on methods that only require the potential energy and its first derivative with respect to the atom coordinates. Such methods can be applied, for example, in plane wave based Density Functional Theory calculations, and the computational effort typically scales well with system size. When the final state of the transition is known, both the initial and final coordinates of the atoms can be used as boundary conditions in the search. Methods of this type include the Nudged Elastic Band, Ridge, Conjugate Peak Refinement, Drag method and the method of Dewar, Healy and Stewart. When only the initial state is known, the problem is more challenging and the search for the saddle point represents also a search for the optimal transition mechanism. We discuss a recently proposed method that can be used in such cases, the Dimer method.},

  abstract = {Solvation of molecules in water is at the heart of a myriad of molecular phenomena and of crucial importance to understanding such diverse issues as chemical reactivity or biomolecular function. Complementing well-established approaches, it has been shown that laser spectroscopy in the THz frequency domain offers new insights into hydration from small solutes to proteins. Upon introducing spatially-resolved analyses of the absorption cross section by simulations, the sensitivity of THz spectroscopy is traced back to characteristic distance-dependent modulations of absorption intensities for bulk water. The prominent peak at approximately 200 cm(-1) is dominated by first-shell dynamics, whereas a concerted motion involving the second solvation shell contributes most significantly to the absorption at about 80 cm(-1) approximately 2.4 THz. The latter can be understood in terms of an umbrella-like motion of two hydrogen-bonded tetrahedra along the connecting hydrogen bond axis. Thus, a modification of the hydrogen bond network, e.g., due to the presence of a solute, is expected to affect vibrational motion and THz absorption intensity at least on a length scale that corresponds to two layers of solvating water molecules. This result provides a molecular mechanism explaining the experimentally determined sensitivity of absorption changes in the THz domain in terms of distinct, solute-induced dynamical properties in solvation shells of (bio)molecules--even in the absence of well-defined resonances.},

  abstract      = {Stochastic thermostats based on the Langevin equation, in which a system is coupled to an external heat bath, are popular methods for temperature control in molecular dynamics simulations due to their ergodicity and their ease of implementation. Traditionally, these thermostats suffer from sluggish behaviour in the limit of high friction, unlike thermostats of the Nos$\backslash$'e-Hoover family whose performance degrades more gently in the strong coupling regime. We propose a simple and easy-to-implement modification to the integration scheme of the Langevin algorithm that addresses the fundamental source of the overdamped behaviour of high-friction Langevin dynamics: if the action of the thermostat causes the momentum of a particle to change direction, it is flipped back. This fast-forward Langevin equation preserves the momentum distribution, and so guarantees the correct equilibrium sampling. It mimics the quadratic behavior of Nos$\backslash$'e-Hoover thermostats, and displays similarly good performance in the strong coupling limit. We test the efficiency of this scheme by applying it to a 1-dimensional harmonic oscillator, as well as to water and Lennard-Jones polymers. The sampling efficiency of the fast-forward Langevin equation thermostat, measured by the correlation time of relevant system variables, is at least as good as the traditional Langevin thermostat, and in the overdamped regime the fast-forward thermostat performs much better, improving the efficiency by an order of magnitude at the highest frictions we considered.},

  abstract      = {The thermodynamic properties of the supercooled liquid state of the mW model of water show anomalous behavior. Like in real water, the heat capacity and compressibility sharply increase upon supercooling. One of the possible explanations of these anomalies, the existence of a second (liquid-liquid) critical point, is not supported by simulations for this model. In this work, we reproduce the anomalies of the mW model with two thermodynamic scenarios: one based on a non-ideal "mixture" with two different types of local order of the water molecules, and one based on weak crystallization theory. We show that both descriptions accurately reproduce the model's basic thermodynamic properties. However, the coupling constant required for the power laws implied by weak crystallization theory is too large relative to the regular backgrounds, contradicting assumptions of weak crystallization theory. Fluctuation corrections outside the scope of this work would be necessary to fit the forms predicted by weak crystallization theory. For the two-state approach, the direct computation of the low-density fraction of molecules in the mW model is in agreement with the prediction of the phenomenological equation of state. The non-ideality of the "mixture" of the two states never becomes strong enough to cause liquid-liquid phase separation, also in agreement with simulation results.},

Comparisons of simulation results for liquid para-hydrogen at two state points and liquid ortho-deuterium at one state point are presented. The calculated quantum correlation functions for the two methods are shown to be in good agreement with one another for a large portion of the time spectrum. However, as the quantum mechanical nature of the system increases, RPMD is less accurate in predicting the kinetic energy of the system than is CMD. A simplified and highly efficient algorithm is proposed which largely corrects this deficiency.},

The method is demonstrated on a simple model system and the 11-residue cyclic peptide cyclosporin A. For comparison, calculations were also performed using simulated temperature annealing and a potential energy annealing scheme. Although the method can only be applied to systems with a small number of degrees of freedom, it offers the chance to generate a multitude of different low-energy structures, where other methods only give a single one or few. This is clearly important in problems such as drug design, where one is interested in the conformational spread of a system.},

It is demonstrated that ad hoc bond-energy bond-order relations derived from bond evolution theory combined with Pauling's valence bond ideas can be used to construct a molecular mechanics guidance potential for the simulation of the proton transfer reaction which improves the statistics of the calculation by three orders of magnitude. The sampling method is extended to simulations in which quantum effects are treated using the imaginary time path-integral representation. A new algorithm based on multiple Markov chain theory is introduced by which it is possible to obtain very short integrated correlation lengths in calculations of quantum static correlation functions.},

At present, most ab initio molecular dynamics calculations are restricted to relatively small systems and short simulation times. In this paper we devise a method that allows well-converged results for infrared spectra from ab initio molecular dynamics simulations using small systems and short trajectories characteristic of simulations typically performed in practice. We demonstrate the utility of our approach by computing the imaginary part of the dielectric constant epsilon"(omega) for H2O and D2O in solid and liquid phases and show that it compares well with experimental data. We further demonstrate that maximally localized Wannier orbitals can be used to separate the individual contributions of different molecular species to the linear spectrum of complex systems. The new spectral decomposition method is shown to be useful in present-day ab initio molecular dynamics calculations to compute the magnitude of the "continuous absorption" generated by excess protons in aqueous solutions with good accuracy even when other species present in the solutions absorb strongly in the same frequency window.},

  abstract      = {Machine learning of atomic-scale properties is revolutionizing molecular modelling, making it possible to evaluate inter-atomic potentials with first-principles accuracy, at a fraction of the costs. The accuracy, speed and reliability of machine-learning potentials, however, depends strongly on the way atomic configurations are represented, i.e. the choice of descriptors used as input for the machine learning method. The raw Cartesian coordinates are typically transformed in "fingerprints", or "symmetry functions", that are designed to encode, in addition to the structure, important properties of the potential-energy surface like its invariances with respect to rotation, translation and permutation of like atoms. Here we discuss automatic protocols to select a number of fingerprints out of a large pool of candidates, based on the correlations that are intrinsic to the training data. This procedure can greatly simplify the construction of neural network potentials that strike the best balance between accuracy and computational efficiency, and has the potential to accelerate by orders of magnitude the evaluation of Gaussian Approximation Potentials based on the Smooth Overlap of Atomic Positions kernel. We present applications to the construction of neural network potentials for water and for an Al-Mg-Si alloy, and to the prediction of the formation energies of small organic molecules using Gaussian process regression.},

On the one hand, studies that analyse structure directly only show local structuring in a solute's first and possibly second hydration shells. On the other hand, thermodynamic and kinetic data imply indirectly that structuring occurs much further away. Here, the hydrogen-bond structure of water around halide anions, alkali cations, noble-gas solutes, and at the vapor-water interface is examined using molecular dynamics simulations. In addition to the expected perturbation in the first hydration shell, deviations from bulk behavior are observed at longer range in the rest of the simulation box. In particular, at the longer range, there is an excess of acceptors around halide anions, an excess of donors around alkali cations, weakly enhanced tetrahedrality and an oscillating excess and deficiency of donors and acceptors around noble-gas solutes, and enhanced tetrahedrality at the vapor-water interface. The structuring compensates for the short-range perturbation in water-water hydrogen bonds induced by the solute. Rather than being confined close to the solute, it is spread over as many water molecules as possible, presumably to minimize the perturbation to each water molecule.},

Here we provide evidence that for condensed phases, and in particular for liquid water, CMD produces pronounced artificial redshifts for high-frequency vibrations such as the OH stretching band. This peculiar behavior intrinsic to the CMD method explains part of the unexpectedly large quantum redshifts of the stretching band of liquid water compared to classical frequencies, which is improved after applying a simple and rough "harmonic curvature correction."},

  abstract = {Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation is used to assess the hyper-Rayleigh scattering (HRS) depolarization ratio of liquid nitrobenzene subject to vertically polarized light. In contrast to previous theoretical work, we have quantified both incoherent and coherent scattering arising from positional and orientational inhomogeneities in the molecular distribution. Although coherent scattering is shown to be much less important than in the case of Rayleigh scattering, it can not be neglected. Therefore, our analysis supports the current practice of working with dilute solutions (for which coherent contributions to HRS are truly negligible) to extract the first molecular hyperpolarizability from HRS measurements. In cases where experiments with pure liquids can not be circumvented, our analysis may be used to separate coherent and incoherent signals. Our work, which uses as input static “gas-phase” (hyper)polarizabilities obtained from ab initio calculations, also provides information on the orientations and magnitudes of the local electric fields experienced by the individual molecules in the liquid. For nitrobenzene it is found that the local fields are largely determined by specific dipolar alignment between neighboring pairs of molecules, with consequences on the HRS signal.},

  abstract = {An accurate determination of the potential energy is the crucial step in computer simulations of chemical processes, but using electronic structure methods on-the-fly in molecular dynamics (MD) is computationally too demanding for many systems. Constructing more efficient interatomic potentials becomes intricate with increasing dimensionality of the potential-energy surface (PES), and for numerous systems the accuracy that can be achieved is still not satisfying and far from the reliability of first-principles calculations. Feed-forward neural networks (NNs) have a very flexible functional form, and in recent years they have been shown to be an accurate tool to construct efficient PESs. High-dimensional NN potentials based on environment-dependent atomic energy contributions have been presented for a number of materials. Still, these potentials may be improved by a more detailed structural description, e.g., in form of atom pairs, which directly reflect the atomic interactions and take the chemical environment into account. We present an implementation of an NN method based on atom pairs, and its accuracy and performance are compared to the atom-based NN approach using two very different systems, the methanol molecule and metallic copper. We find that both types of NN potentials provide an excellent description of both PESs, with the pair-based method yielding a slightly higher accuracy making it a competitive alternative for addressing complex systems in MD simulations.},

Even though recent developments have significantly reduced the overhead for modelling the quantum nature of the nuclei, the cost is still prohibitive when combined with advanced electronic structure methods. Here we present how multiple time step integrators can be combined with ring-polymer contraction techniques (effectively, multiple time stepping in imaginary time) to reduce virtually to zero the overhead of modelling nuclear quantum effects, while describing inter-atomic forces at high levels of electronic structure theory. This is demonstrated for a combination of MP2 and semi-local DFT applied to the Zundel cation. The approach can be seamlessly combined with other methods to reduce the computational cost of path integral calculations, such as high-order factorizations of the Boltzmann operator, or generalized Langevin equation thermostats.},

  abstract = {{\"{i}}¿½ 2016 Author(s). The precise description of quantum nuclear fluctuations in atomistic modelling is possible by employing path integral techniques, which involve a considerable computational overhead due to the need of simulating multiple replicas of the system. Many approaches have been suggested to reduce the required number of replicas. Among these, high-order factorizations of the Boltzmann operator are particularly attractive for high-precision and low-temperature scenarios. Unfortunately, to date, several technical challenges have prevented a widespread use of these approaches to study the nuclear quantum effects in condensed-phase systems. Here we introduce an inexpensive molecular dynamics scheme that overcomes these limitations, thus making it possible to exploit the improved convergence of high-order path integrals without having to sacrifice the stability, convenience, and flexibility of conventional second-order techniques. The capabilities of the method are demonstrated by simulations of liquid water and ice, as described by a neural-network potential fitted to the dispersion-corrected hybrid density functional theory calculations.},

  abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 American Chemical Society. One of the many peculiar properties of water is the pronounced deviation of the proton momentum distribution from Maxwell-Boltzmann behaviour. This deviation from the classical limit is a manifestation of the quantum mechanical nature of protons. Its extent, which can be probed directly by Deep Inelastic Neutron Scattering (DINS) experiments, gives important insight on the potential of mean force felt by H atoms. The determination of the full distribution of particle momenta, however, is a real tour de force for both experiments and theory, which has led to unresolved discrepancies between the two. In this Letter we present comprehensive, fully-converged momentum distributions for water at several thermodynamic state points, focusing on the components that cannot be described in terms of a scalar contribution to the quantum kinetic energy, and providing a benchmark that can serve as a reference for future simulations and experiments. In doing so, we also introduce a number of technical developments that simplify and accelerate greatly the calculation of momentum distributions by means of atomistic simulations.},

Although graphite is probably the most widely known layered material, nowadays transition metal dichal-cogenides (TMDs) are attracting much attention due to a range of exciting applications, including electrode materials for ion batter-ies 1 , thermoelectrics 2 , catalysis 3 , topological insulators 4 , supercon-ductors 5 , and charge-density-wave materials 6 . In addition, single layers of TMDs are available due to the weak interlayer interaction 7 . Mono-and few-layer TMDs have unique properties which cannot appear in the bulk 8 , and heterostructures built layer by layer using different materials have entirely new properties 9 . In all the numer-ous fundamental and applied investigations of vdW materials, the weak interlayer interactions play a central role in the formation, intercalation, exfoliation and layer-by-layer building of the materi-als as well as being decisive for their unique properties. Here we provide the experimental quantification of interlayer interactions in the archetypal vdW material TiS 2 through modelling of structure factors extracted from accurate single-crystal synchrotron X-ray diffraction measurements. In TMDs, a transition metal atom (M) layer is sandwiched by two chalcogen atom (X) layers. It is commonly assumed that the MX 2 slabs are stacked by vdW interactions, whereas the intralayer M–X interactions are covalent. The interlayer part of the structure is typically referred to as the vdW gap. In the condensed-matter field, the vdW term is used typically for London dispersion forces, which are caused by instantaneously induced dipoles 10},

The peptides are observed to maintain a high tolerance for sequence modification, allowing control over surface chemistry via their amino acid sequence. Furthermore, through a single-step coassembly of two differently designed peptides, we predictably and precisely tune the wettability of the resulting functionalized graphite surfaces from 44° to 83°. The modular molecular structures and predictable behavior of short peptides demonstrated here give rise to a novel platform for functionalizing graphitic materials that offers numerous advantages, including noninvasive modification of the substrate, biocompatible processing in an aqueous environment, and simple fusion with other functional biological molecules.},

At lower temperatures, the formation of the metastable hexagonal polymorph of diamond is favoured instead of the more stable cubic diamond. These phenomena cannot be explained by the concerted mechanism suggested in previous theoretical studies. Using an ab initio quality neural-network potential, we carried out a large-scale study of the graphite-to-diamond transition assuming that it occurs through nucleation. The nucleation mechanism accounts for the observed phenomenology and reveals its microscopic origins. We demonstrate that the large lattice distortions that accompany the formation of diamond nuclei inhibit the phase transition at low pressure, and direct it towards the hexagonal diamond phase at higher pressure. The proposed nucleation mechanism should improve our understanding of structural transformations in a wide range of carbon-based materials.},

In the present study, we attempt to shed light on the mechanisms involved in the loss of one molar equivalent of H(2) from solid lithium amidoboranes by using high-level ab initio calculations of monomeric and dimeric compounds in the gas phase. In the lithium amidoborane dimer, H(2) is released by the formation of LiH, which is followed by a redox reaction of the dihydrogen bond formed between the strongly basic H(-) in LiH and H(delta+) bonded to N. In the dehydrogenation process, the Li cation catalyzes the intermolecular N-B bond formation; this could lead to new pathways for N-B polymerization. After the release of the first molecule of H(2), a Li cation binds to a nitrogen atom, resulting in a lowering of the energy barrier for the second dehydrogenation process per dimer. These results will be useful for the design of future hydrogen-storage media.},

Therefore, applications of DFT to systems where dispersion is important have traditionally been of questionable accuracy. However, the last decade has seen a surge of enthusiasm in the DFT community to tackle this problem and in so-doing to extend the applicability of DFT-based methods. Here we discuss, classify, and evaluate some of the promising schemes to emerge in recent years.

We show that Sinkhorn-Knopp belongs to this family, but other members can converge much more quickly. In particular, we show that while stationary iterative methods offer little or no improvement in many cases, a scheme using a preconditioned conjugate gradient method as the inner iteration converges at much lower cost (in terms of matrix-vector products) for a broad range of matrices; and succeeds in cases where the Sinkhorn-Knopp algorithm fails.},

We have performed a series of large-scale simulations using a number of parameter-free exchange and correlation functionals, to minimize and investigate the influence of finite size effects as well as statistical errors. We find that finite size effects in structural properties are rather small and, given an extensive sampling, reproducible. On the other hand, the influence of finite size effects on dynamical properties are much larger than generally appreciated. So much so that the infinite size limit is practically out of reach. However, using a finite size scaling procedure, thanks to the greater effectiveness of our new method we can estimate both the thermodynamic value of the diffusion coefficient and the shear viscosity.

  abstract = {A series of first principles molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo simulations were carried out for liquid water to investigate the reproducibility of different sampling approaches. These simulations include Car−Parrinello molecular dynamics simulations using the program cpmd with different values of the fictitious electron mass in the microcanonical and canonical ensembles, Born−Oppenheimer molecular dynamics using the programs cpmd and cp2k in the microcanonical ensemble, and Metropolis Monte Carlo using cp2k in the canonical ensemble. With the exception of one simulation for 128 water molecules, all other simulations were carried out for systems consisting of 64 molecules. Although the simulations yield somewhat fortuitous agreement in structural properties, analysis of other properties demonstrate that one should exercise caution when assuming the reproducibility of Car−Parrinello and Born−Oppenheimer molecular dynamics simulations for small system sizes in the microcanonical ensemble. In contrast, the molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo simulations in the canonical ensemble appear to be more reliable. Furthermore, in the case of canonical Car−Parrinello molecular dynamics simulations the application of Nos{\{}{\'{e}}{\}}−Hoover chain thermostats allows the use of larger fictitious electron masses. For the Becke−Lee−Yang−Parr exchange and correlation energy functionals and norm-conserving Troullier−Martins or Goedecker−Teter−Hutter pseudopotentials, these simulations at a fixed density of 1.0 g/cm3 and a temperature close to 315 K point to an overstructured liquid with a height of the first peak in the oxygen−oxygen radial distribution function of about 3.0, an underestimated value of the classical constant-volume heat capacity of about 70 J/(mol K), and an underestimated self-diffusion constant of about 0.04 {\{}{\AA}{\}}2/ps.},

  abstract = {Despite long study, a molecular picture of the mechanism of water reorientation is still lacking. Using numerical simulations, we find support for a pathway in which the rotating water molecule breaks a hydrogen bond (H-bond) with an overcoordinated first-shell neighbor to form an H-bond with an undercoordinated second-shell neighbor. The H-bond cleavage and the molecular reorientation occur concertedly and not successively as usually considered. This water reorientation mechanism involves large-amplitude angular jumps, rather than the commonly accepted sequence of small diffusive steps, and therefore calls for reinterpretation of many experimental data wherein water rotational relaxation is assumed to be diffusive.},

The water reorientation is shown to occur through large-amplitude angular jumps due to the exchange of hydrogen (H)-bond acceptors, with a minor contribution from the diffusive H-bond frame reorientation between these exchanges. The robust character of this mechanism with respect to different water models is discussed. We fully characterize these jump events, including the distributions of trajectories around the average path. The average path values and the distributions of the jump time and the jump amplitude, the two key parameters in the Ivanov jump model component of the EJM, are determined. We also discuss the possibility of selectively exciting water molecules close to the jump event, of interest for ultrafast infrared experiments. In addition to a comparison of predicted reorientation times with experimental results, the reorientation time temperature dependence is discussed. A detailed description of the pathway free energetics for the water reorientation is presented; this is used to identify the jump rate-limiting step as the translational motion in which the initial H-bond of the reorientating water is elongated and the new H-bond acceptor water approaches.},

  abstract = {Nowadays, simulation techniques are routinely used to generate accurate models of the structures of crystalline and amorphous solids, to study surfaces, defects and the properties of complex systems, and to screen possible candidate materials for the most diverse types of technological applications. The screening of novel molecular structures has been so far pursued by calculation of intrinsic properties with first-principle methods. Still, the use of intrinsic properties as scoring functions may not always be optimal for systems of high complexity. In these cases, increasingly detailed and realistic simulations that take into account the interaction with the surrounding molecules are of crucial importance. In this paper, we present an effective way to screen different solvents with respect to their chemical stability versus Li 2 O 2 solid particles. To achieve this, the minimum energy paths for different types of reactions of a series of aprotic solvents (acetonitrile and pivalonitrile, dimethyl sulphoxide, N -methyl-2-pyrrolidone and some of its derivatives, penta ethylene glycol (PEG-5) and a fluorinated derivative) with solid Li 2 O 2 are computed and reported. From these data, we can extract the reaction energy barriers, which compare extremely well with the available experimental data and offer a convenient way for screening and designing suitable solvents for Li–air batteries from first-principle calculations.},

  abstract      = {We calculate the solid-liquid interfacial free energy gamma(sl) for the Lennard-Jones (LJ) system at several points along the pressure-temperature coexistence curve using molecular-dynamics simulation and Gibbs-Cahn integration. This method uses the excess interfacial energy (e) and stress (tau) along the coexistence curve to determine a differential equation for gamma(sl) as a function of temperature. Given the values of gamma(sl) for the (100), (110), and (111) LJ interfaces at the triple-point temperature (T( *)=kT/varepsilon=0.618), previously obtained using the cleaving method by Davidchack and Laird [J. Chem. Phys. 118, 7657 (2003)], this differential equation can be integrated to obtain gamma(sl) for these interfaces at higher coexistence temperatures. Our values for gamma(sl) calculated in this way at T( *)=1.0 and 1.5 are in good agreement with those determined previously by cleaving, but were obtained with significantly less computational effort than required by either the cleaving method or the capillary fluctuation method of Hoyt, Asta, and Karma [Phys. Rev. Lett. 86, 5530 (2001)]. In addition, the orientational anisotropy in the excess interface energy, stress and entropy, calculated using the conventional Gibbs dividing surface, are seen to be significantly larger than the relatively small anisotropies in gamma(sl) itself.},

A cubic unit of (LiH)(4) is predicted to react readily with NH(3)BH(3) to form LiNH(2)BH(3) plus H(2). The (LiH)(4) tetramer enables dehydrogenation through the exchange of a hydride vertex of (LiH)(4) and NH(2)BH(3)(-) where NH(2)BH(3)(-) is formed when the hydride vertex of (LiH)(4) abstracts a proton from NH(3). The free energy of activation for loss of H(2) is reduced from 37.2 kcal/mol in NH(3)BH(3) to 11.0 kcal/mol in (LiH)(4) + NH(3)BH(3). Further, H(2) elimination from the (LiNH(2)BH(3))(2) dimer is predicted to be much easier than from the monomer which may suggest a cooperative H(2)-loss mechanism is possible in solid LiNH(2)BH(3). While two molecules of H(2) can be lost reversibly from (LiNH(2)BH(3))(2), loss of further H(2) molecules is more difficult but could occur if the lattice energy stabilization accompanying H(2) loss is sufficiently large.},

The methods are based on the application of deterministic impulses, drifts, and Brownian motions in some combination. The Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff expansion is used to study sampling accuracy following recent work by the authors, which allows determination of the stepsize-dependent bias in configurational averaging. For harmonic oscillators, configurational averaging is exact for certain schemes, which may result in improved performance in the modelling of biomolecules where bond stretches play a prominent role. For general systems, an optimal method can be identified that has very low bias compared to alternatives. In simulations of the alanine dipeptide reported here (both solvated and unsolvated), higher accuracy is obtained without loss of computational efficiency, while allowing large timestep, and with no impairment of the conformational exploration rate (the effective diffusion rate observed in simulation). The optimal scheme is a uniformly better performing algorithm for molecular sampling, with overall efficiency improvements of 25{\%} or more in practical timestep size achievable in vacuum, and with reductions in the error of configurational averages of a factor of ten or more attainable in solvated simulations at large timestep.},

  abstract = {Global energy consumption is projected to increase, even in the face of substantial declines in energy intensity, at least 2-fold by midcentury relative to the present because of population and economic growth. This demand could be met, in principle, from fossil energy resources, particularly coal. However, the cumulative nature of CO(2) emissions in the atmosphere demands that holding atmospheric CO(2) levels to even twice their preanthropogenic values by midcentury will require invention, development, and deployment of schemes for carbon-neutral energy production on a scale commensurate with, or larger than, the entire present-day energy supply from all sources combined. Among renewable energy resources, solar energy is by far the largest exploitable resource, providing more energy in 1 hour to the earth than all of the energy consumed by humans in an entire year. In view of the intermittency of insolation, if solar energy is to be a major primary energy source, it must be stored and dispatched on demand to the end user. An especially attractive approach is to store solar-converted energy in the form of chemical bonds, i.e., in a photosynthetic process at a year-round average efficiency significantly higher than current plants or algae, to reduce land-area requirements. Scientific challenges involved with this process include schemes to capture and convert solar energy and then store the energy in the form of chemical bonds, producing oxygen from water and a reduced fuel such as hydrogen, methane, methanol, or other hydrocarbon species.},

In particular, for two atomistic models of water, we have computed free energies as functions of multiple order parameters, where one is density and another distinguishes crystal from liquid. For a range of temperatures and pressures, separate free energy basins for liquid and crystal are found, conditions of phase coexistence between these phases are demonstrated, and time scales for equilibration are determined. We find that at no range of temperatures and pressures is there more than a single liquid basin, even at conditions where amorphous behavior is unstable with respect to the crystal. We find a similar result for a related model of silicon. This result excludes the possibility of the proposed liquid-liquid critical point for the models we have studied. Further, we argue that behaviors others have attributed to a liquid-liquid transition in water and related systems are in fact reflections of transitions between liquid and crystal.},

  abstract  = {One of the main bottlenecks to deploying large-scale carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS) in power plants is the energy required to separate the CO(2) from flue gas. For example, near-term CCS technology applied to coal-fired power plants is projected to reduce the net output of the plant by some 30{\%} and to increase the cost of electricity by 60-80{\%}. Developing capture materials and processes that reduce the parasitic energy imposed by CCS is therefore an important area of research. We have developed a computational approach to rank adsorbents for their performance in CCS. Using this analysis, we have screened hundreds of thousands of zeolite and zeolitic imidazolate framework structures and identified many different structures that have the potential to reduce the parasitic energy of CCS by 30-40{\%} compared with near-term technologies.},

  abstract = {We investigate the accuracy provided by different treatments of the exchange and correlation effects, in particular the London dispersion forces, on the properties of liquid water using ab initio molecular dynamics simulations with density functional theory. The lack of London dispersion forces in generalized gradient approximations (GGAs) is remedied by means of dispersion-corrected atom-centered potentials (DCACPs) or damped atom-pairwise dispersion corrections of the C6R?6 form. We compare results from simulations using GGA density functionals (BLYP, PBE, and revPBE) with data from their van der Waals (vdW) corrected counterparts. As pointed out previously, all vdW-corrected BLYP simulations give rise to highly mobile water whose softened structure is closer to experimental data than the one predicted by the bare BLYP functional. Including vdW interactions in the PBE functional, on the other hand, has little influence on both structural and dynamical properties of water. Augmenting the revPBE functional with either damped atom-pairwise dispersion corrections or DCACP evokes opposite behaviors. The former further softens the already under-structured revPBE water, whereas the latter makes it more glassy. These results demonstrate the delicacy needed in describing weak interactions in molecular liquids.},

  abstract      = {Water molecules adsorbed on inorganic substrates play an important role in several technological applications. In the presence of light atoms in adsorbates, nuclear quantum effects (NQE) influence properties of these systems. In this work, we explore the impact of NQE on the dissociation of water wires on stepped Pt(221) surfaces. By performing ab initio molecular dynamics simulations with van der Waals corrected density functional theory, we note that several competing minima for both intact and dissociated structures are accessible at finite temperatures, making it important to assess whether harmonic estimates of the quantum free energy are sufficient to determine the relative stability of the different states. We perform ab initio path integral molecular dynamics (PIMD) in order to calculate these contributions taking into account conformational entropy and anharmonicities at finite temperatures. We propose that when when adsorption is weak and NQE on the substrate are negligible, PIMD simulations can be performed through a simple partition of the system, resulting in considerable computational savings. We calculate the contribution of NQE to the free energies, including anharmonic terms. We find that they result in an increase of up to 20{\%} of the quantum contribution to the dissociation free energy compared to harmonic estimates. We also find that the dissociation has a negligible contribution from tunneling, but is dominated by ZPE, which can enhance the rate by three orders of magnitude. Finally we highlight how both temperature and NQE indirectly impact dipoles and the redistribution of electron density, causing work function to changes of up to 0.4 eV with respect to static estimates. This quantitative determination of the change in work function provides a possible approach to determine experimentally the most stable configurations of water oligomers on the stepped surfaces.},

  abstract = {The thermal Gaussian approximation (TGA) recently developed by Frantsuzov et al. [Chem. Phys. Lett. 381, 117 (2003)] has been demonstrated to be a practical way for approximating the Boltzmann operator exp(-betaH) for multidimensional systems. In this paper the TGA is combined with semiclassical (SC) initial value representations (IVRs) for thermal time correlation functions. Specifically, it is used with the linearized SC-IVR (LSC-IVR, equivalent to the classical Wigner model), and the "forward-backward semiclassical dynamics" approximation developed by Shao and Makri [J. Phys. Chem. A 103, 7753 (1999); 103, 9749 (1999)]. Use of the TGA with both of these approximate SC-IVRs allows the oscillatory part of the IVR to be integrated out explicitly, providing an extremely simple result that is readily applicable to large molecular systems. Calculation of the force-force autocorrelation for a strongly anharmonic oscillator demonstrates its accuracy, and calculation of the velocity autocorrelation function (and thus the diffusion coefficient) of liquid neon demonstrates its applicability.},

It significantly extends the range of accuracy of conventional local harmonic approximations (LHAs) used in the linearized semiclassical initial value representation/classical Wigner approximation for real time correlation functions. The key idea is realizing that a local Gaussian approximation (LGA) for the momentum distribution (from the Wigner function involving the Boltzmann operator) can be a good approximation even when a LHA for the potential energy surface fails. The model is applied here to two examples where imaginary frequencies play a significant role: the chemical reaction rate for a linear model of the H+H(2) reaction and an analogous asymmetric barrier--a case where the imaginary frequency of the barrier dominates the process--and for momentum autocorrelation functions in liquid para-hydrogen at two thermal state points (25 and 14 K under nearly zero external pressure). We also generalize the LGA model to the Feynman-Kleinert approximation.},

  abstract = {The important role of liquid water in many areas of science from chemistry, physics, biology, geology to climate research, etc., has motivated numerous theoretical studies of its structure and dynamics. The significance of quantum effects on the properties of water, however, has not yet been fully resolved. In this paper we focus on quantum dynamical effects in liquid water based on the linearized semiclassical initial value representation (LSC-IVR) with a quantum version of the simple point charge/flexible (q-SPC/fw) model [Paesani et al., J. Chem. Phys. 125, 184507 (2006)] for the potential energy function. The infrared (IR) absorption spectrum and the translational diffusion constants have been obtained from the corresponding thermal correlation functions, and the effects of intermolecular and intramolecular correlations have been studied. The LSC-IVR simulation results are compared with those predicted by the centroid molecular dynamics (CMD) approach. Although the LSC-IVR and CMD results agree well for the broadband for hindered motions in liquid water, the intramolecular bending and O-H stretching peaks predicted by the LSC-IVR are blueshifted from those given by CMD; reasons for this are discussed. We also suggest that the broadband in the IR spectrum corresponding to restricted translation and libration gives more information than the diffusion constant on the nature of quantum effects on translational and rotational motions and should thus receive more attention in this regard.},

Although the LSC-IVR (LGA) gives the exact result for the isolated three-dimensional shifted harmonic stretching model, it yields a blueshifted peak position for the more realistic anharmonic stretching potential. By using the short-time information of the LSC-IVR correlation function; however, it is shown how one can obtain more accurate results for the position of the stretching peak. Due to the physical decay in the condensed phase system, the LSC-IVR (LGA) is a good and practical approximate quantum approach for the IR spectrum of liquid water. The present results offer valuable insight into future attempts to improve the accuracy of the TTM3-F potential or other ab initio-based models in reproducing the IR spectrum of liquid water.},

  abstract = {Multicomponent diffusion in liquids is ubiquitous in (bio)chemical processes. It has gained considerable and increasing interest as it is often the rate limiting step in a process. In this paper, we review methods for calculating diffusion coefficients from molecular simulation and predictive engineering models. The main achievements of our research during the past years can be summarized as follows: (1) we introduced a consistent method for computing Fick diffusion coefficients using equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations; (2) we developed a multicomponent Darken equation for the description of the concentration dependence of Maxwell–Stefan diffusivities. In the case of infinite dilution, the multicomponent Darken equation provides an expression for which can be used to parametrize the generalized Vignes equation; and (3) a predictive model for self-diffusivities was proposed for the parametrization of the multicomponent Darken equation. This equation accurately describes the concentration dependence of self-diffusivities in weakly associating systems. With these methods, a sound framework for the prediction of mutual diffusion in liquids is achieved.},

We employ the criterion of reversible transitions between amorphous "states" in finite intervals of pressure and temperature to discriminate between independent metastable amorphous "states" and between "substates" of the same amorphous "state". We argue that the experimental evidence suggests we should consider there to be three polyamorphic "states" of ice, namely low-(LDA), high-(HDA) and very high-density amorphous ice (VHDA). In addition to the realization of reversible transitions between them, they differ in terms of their properties, e.g., compressibility, or number of "interstitial" water molecules. Thus they cannot be regarded as structurally relaxed variants of each other and so we suggest considering them as three distinct megabasins in an energy landscape visualization.},

  abstract  = {A collaborative workshop was held in May 1999 at the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre to test how well currently available methods of crystal structure prediction perform when given only the atomic connectivity for an organic compound. A blind test was conducted on a selection of four compounds and a wide range of methodologies representing the principal computer programs currently available were used. There were 11 participants who were allowed to propose at most three structures for each compound. No program gave consistently reliable results. However, seven proposed structures were close to an experimental one and were classified as `correct'. One compound occurred in two polymorphs, but only one form was predicted correctly among the calculated structures. The basic problem with lattice energy based methods of crystal structure prediction is that many structures are found within a few kJ mol-1 of the global minimum. The fine detail of the force-field methodology and parametrization influences the energy ranking within each method. Nevertheless, present methods may be useful in providing a set of structures as possible polymorphs for a given molecular structure.},

The mechanism of hydrogen release from metal amidoboranes, a metal ion assisted hydride transfer, is very different than the mechanism of hydrogen release from the parent compound ammonia borane (AB). On the basis of the observed trends in reaction rates of H {\textgreater} Me {\textgreater} (t)Bu, K {\textgreater} Na {\textgreater} Li, and the kinetic isotope effect, the mechanism of hydrogen release from MAB compounds was found to proceed through a bimolecular mechanism involving the intermediacy of a MH (M = Li, Na, or K). The non-volatile products formed from MABs are significantly different than the products formed after hydrogen release from AB. The boron containing products resulting from the release of 1 equiv of hydrogen from the metal amidoboranes were characterized by MAS (11)B NMR spectroscopy and found to contain both BH(3) and sp(2) hybridized BH groups, consistent with the general structure MN(R)=BHN(R)MBH(3).},

Originally, it was thought that an ion's influence on macromolecular properties was caused at least in part by 'making' or 'breaking' bulk water structure. Recent time-resolved and thermodynamic studies of water molecules in salt solutions, however, demonstrate that bulk water structure is not central to the Hofmeister effect. Instead, models are being developed that depend upon direct ion-macromolecule interactions as well as interactions with water molecules in the first hydration shell of the macromolecule.},

  abstract = {A quantum simulation of an imaginary time path integral typically requires around n times more computational effort than the corresponding classical simulation, where n is the number of ring polymer beads (or imaginary time slices) used in the calculation. However, this estimate neglects the fact that the potential energies of many systems can be decomposed into a sum of rapidly varying short-range and slowly varying long-range contributions. For such systems, the computational effort of the path integral simulation can be reduced considerably by evaluating the long-range forces on a contracted ring polymer with fewer beads than are needed to evaluate the short-range forces. This idea is developed and then illustrated with an application to a flexible model of liquid water in which the intramolecular forces are evaluated with 32 beads, the oxygen-oxygen Lennard-Jones forces with seven, and the intermolecular electrostatic forces with just five. The resulting static and dynamic properties are within a few percent of those of a full 32-bead calculation, and yet they are obtained with a computational effort less than six times (rather than 32 times) that of a classical simulation. We hope that this development will encourage future studies of quantum mechanical fluctuations in liquid water and aqueous solutions and in many other systems with similar interaction potentials.},

Using this methodology for classical multistate empirical valence bond (MS-EVB) and ab initio molecular dynamics trajectories, as well as quantal MS-EVB trajectories, we supply statistical proof that proton hops in liquid water occur by a transition from the H3O+[3H2O] Eigen-complex, via the H5O2+ Zundel-complex, to a H3O+[3H2O] centered on a neighboring water molecule. In the "resting period" before a transition, there is a distorted hydronium with one of its water ligands at a shorter distance and another at a longer distance than average. The identity of this "special partner" interchanges rapidly within the three first-shell water ligands. This is coupled to cleavage of an acceptor-type hydrogen bond. Just before the transition, a partner is selected by an additional translation of the H3O+ moiety in its direction, possibly enabled by loosening of donor-type hydrogen bonds on the opposite side. We monitor the transition in real time, showing how the average structure is converted to a distorted H5O2+ cation constituting the transitional complex for proton hopping between water molecules.},

  abstract      = {Path integral molecular dynamics simulations, combined with an ab initio evaluation of interactions using electronic structure theory, incorporate the quantum mechanical nature of both the electrons and nuclei, which are essential to accurately describe systems containing light nuclei. However, path integral simulations have traditionally required a computational cost around two orders of magnitude greater than treating the nuclei classically, making them prohibitively costly for most applications. Here we show that the cost of path integral simulations can be dramatically reduced by extending our ring polymer contraction approach to ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. By using density functional tight binding as a reference system, we show that our ab initio ring polymer contraction (AI-RPC) scheme gives rapid and systematic convergence to the full path integral density functional theory result. We demonstrate the efficiency of this approach in ab initio simulations of liquid water and the reactive protonated and deprotonated water dimer systems. We find that the vast majority of the nuclear quantum effects are accurately captured using contraction to just the ring polymer centroid, which requires the same number of density functional theory calculations as a classical simulation. Combined with a multiple time step scheme using the same reference system, which allows the time step to be increased, our implementation is as fast as a typical classical ab initio molecular dynamics simulation and 35{\$}\backslashtimes{\$} faster than a full path integral calculation, while still exactly including the quantum sampling of nuclei. This development thus offers a route to routinely include nuclear quantum effects in ab initio molecular dynamics simulations at negligible computational cost.},

Here we show that this combination provides accurate structure and dynamics, including the full infra-red and Raman spectra of liquid water.

At the heart of this family of in silico techniques lies the crucial idea of computing the many-body interactions by solving the electronic structure problem "on the fly" as the simulation proceeds, which circumvents the need for pre-parameterized potential models. In particular, the field of proton transfer in hydrogen-bonded networks greatly benefits from these technical advances. Here, several systems of seemingly quite different nature and of increasing complexity, such as Grotthuss diffusion in water, excited-state proton-transfer in solution, phase transitions in ice, and protonated water networks in the membrane protein bacteriorhodopsin, are discussed in the realms of a unifying viewpoint.},

We find that the molecular liquid phase is unexpectedly stable, and the transition towards a fully atomic liquid phase occurs at much higher pressure than previously believed. The old standing problem of low-temperature atomization is, therefore, still far from experimental reach.},

  abstract = {Noncovalent interactions are of fundamental importance across the disciplines of chemistry, materi-als science, and biology. Quantum chemical calculations on noncovalently bound complexes, which allow for the quantification of properties such as binding energies and geometries, play an essen-tial role in advancing our understanding of, and building models for, a vast array of complex processes involving molecular association or self-assembly. Because of its relatively modest com-putational cost, second-order M{\o}ller-Plesset perturbation (MP2) theory is one of the most widely used methods in quantum chemistry for studying noncovalent interactions. MP2 is, however, plagued by serious errors due to its incomplete treatment of electron correlation, especially when model-ing van der Waals interactions and $\pi$-stacked complexes. Here we present spin-network-scaled MP2 (SNS-MP2), a new semi-empirical MP2-based method for dimer interaction-energy calculations. To correct for errors in MP2, SNS-MP2 uses quantum chemical features of the complex under study in conjunction with a neural network to reweight terms appearing in the total MP2 interac-tion energy. The method has been trained on a new data set consisting of over 200 000 complete basis set (CBS)-extrapolated coupled-cluster interaction energies, which are considered the gold standard for chemical accuracy. SNS-MP2 predicts gold-standard binding energies of unseen test compounds with a mean absolute error of 0.04 kcal mol 1 (root-mean-square error 0.09 kcal mol 1), a 6-to 7-fold improvement over MP2. To the best of our knowledge, its accuracy exceeds that of all extant density functional theory-and wavefunction-based methods of similar computational cost, and is very close to the intrinsic accuracy of our benchmark coupled-cluster methodology itself. Further-more, SNS-MP2 provides reliable per-conformation confidence intervals on the predicted interaction},

  abstract = {This work considers how the properties of hydrogen bonded complexes, X-H⋯Y, are modified by the quantum motion of the shared proton. Using a simple two-diabatic state model Hamiltonian, the analysis of the symmetric case, where the donor (X) and acceptor (Y) have the same proton affinity, is carried out. For quantitative comparisons, a parametrization specific to the O-H⋯O complexes is used. The vibrational energy levels of the one-dimensional ground state adiabatic potential of the model are used to make quantitative comparisons with a vast body of condensed phase data, spanning a donor-acceptor separation (R) range of about 2.4 - 3.0 {\AA}, i.e., from strong to weak hydrogen bonds. The position of the proton (which determines the X-H bond length) and its longitudinal vibrational frequency, along with the isotope effects in both are described quantitatively. An analysis of the secondary geometric isotope effect, using a simple extension of the two-state model, yields an improved agreement of the predicted variation with R of frequency isotope effects. The role of bending modes is also considered: their quantum effects compete with those of the stretching mode for weak to moderate H-bond strengths. In spite of the economy in the parametrization of the model used, it offers key insights into the defining features of H-bonds, and semi-quantitatively captures several trends.},

  abstract = {This paper explores the dynamics of a highly rotationally and vibrationally excited radical, CD2CD2OH. The radical is produced from the 193 nm photodissociation of 2-bromoethanol-d4, so it is imparted with high angular momentum and high vibrational energy and subsequently dissociates to several product channels. This paper focuses on characterizing its angular momentum and modeling its effect on the product channels, including the HOD + vinyl-d3 product channel resulting from a frustrated dissociation of the radical originally en route to OH + ethene-d4 that instead results in D atom abstraction. Our impulsive model of the initial photodissociation shows that, for some cases, upward of 200 au of angular momentum is imparted, which greatly affects the dynamics of the competing product channels. Using a permutationally invariant potential energy surface and quasiclassical trajectories, we simulated the dissociation dynamics of CD2CD2OH and compared these results to those of Kamarchik et al. (J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 2010, 1, 3058-3065), who studied the dynamics of CH2CH2OH with zero angular momentum. We found that the recoil translational energy distribution for radicals that dissociated to OH + C2D4 matched experiment closely only when high angular momentum of the initial radical was explicitly included in the trajectory calculations. Similarly, the rate constant for dissociation changes when rotational energy was added to the vibrational energy in the initial conditions. Lastly, we applied the sketch-map dimensionality reduction technique to analyze mechanistic information leading to the vinyl + water product channel. Projecting the ab initio intrinsic reaction coordinates onto the lower dimensional space identified with sketch map offers new insight into the dynamics when one looks at the simulated trajectories in the lower dimensional space. Further analysis shows that the transition path resembles a frustrated dissociation of the OH + ethene radical adduct, followed instead by branching to vinyl + water when the leaving OH group encounters a nearby D atom on the ethene moiety. This characterization is in accord with the one made previously. We show that the transition path bifurcation between the two similar channels occurs at carbon-oxygen distances and oxygen-abstracted deuterium distances of 2-2.5 {\{}{\AA}{\}} controlled by the C-O-D bond angle with large angles preferentially branching to the water plus vinyl product state. The experimental branching ratios were not reproduced by theory, however, due partly to the insufficient quality of the fitted potential surface. We also have evidence of a minor product channel, HD + vinoxy-d3, from our molecular dynamics simulations that allows us to assign the HD signal in prior experimental work.},

For both fully atomistic and system-bath representations of condensed-phase ET, we demonstrate that RPMD accurately predicts both ET reaction rates and mechanisms throughout the normal and activationless regimes of the thermodynamic driving force. Analysis of the ensemble of reactive RPMD trajectories reveals the solvent reorganization mechanism for ET that is anticipated in the Marcus rate theory, and the accuracy of the RPMD rate calculation is understood in terms of its exact description of statistical fluctuations and its formal connection to semiclassical instanton theory for deep-tunneling processes. In the inverted regime of the thermodynamic driving force, neither RPMD nor a related formulation of semiclassical instanton theory capture the characteristic turnover in the reaction rate; comparison with exact quantum dynamics simulations reveals that these methods provide inadequate quantization of the real-time electronic-state dynamics in the inverted regime.},

The diffusion coefficients D(L) obtained in simulations with finite system sizes are therefore too small. However, the extrapolation to infinite system size corrects this deficiency and leads to excellent agreement with experimental results. This both demonstrates the influence of system-size effects on quantum mechanical diffusion coefficients and provides further evidence that ring-polymer molecular dynamics is an accurate as well as practical way of including quantum effects in condensed phase molecular dynamics.},

Furthermore, we have determined the melting curve of molecular hydrogen up to pressures of 200 GPa, finding a reentrant melting line. The melting line crosses the metalization line at 700 K and 220 GPa using density functional energetics and at 550 K and 290 GPa using quantum Monte Carlo energetics.},

We consider the importance of nuclear quantum effects on equilibrium properties and find that they strongly influence intramolec- ular properties, such as bond fluctuations and stability. We demonstrate that the combination of both thermal and quantum effects make a drastic change to the predicted optical properties of the molecular solid, suggesting a limited value to dynamical, e.g., finite-temperature, predictions based on classical ions and static crystals. We also consider the influence of the chosen exchange– correlation density functional on the predicted properties of hydrogen, in particular, the pressure dependence of the band gap and the zero-point energy. Finally, we use our simulations to make an assessment of the accuracy of typically employed approximations to the calculation of the Gibbs free energy of the solid, namely the quasi-harmonic approximation for solids. We find that, while the approximation is capable of producing free energies with an accuracy of ≈ 10 meV, this is not enough to make reliable predictions of the phase diagram of hydrogen from first-principles due to the small free energy differences seen between several potential structures for the solid; direct free energy calculations for quantum protons are required in order to make definite predictions.},

  abstract      = {While the interactions between water molecules are dominated by strongly directional hydrogen bonds (HBs), it was recently proposed that relatively weak, isotropic van der Waals (vdW) forces are essential for understanding the properties of liquid water and ice. This insight was derived from ab initio computer simulations, which provide an unbiased description of water at the atomic level and yield information on the underlying molecular forces. However, the high computational cost of such simulations prevents the systematic investigation of the influence of vdW forces on the thermodynamic anomalies of water. Here we develop efficient ab initio-quality neural network potentials and use them to demonstrate that vdW interactions are crucial for the formation of water's density maximum and its negative volume of melting. Both phenomena can be explained by the flexibility of the HB network, which is the result of a delicate balance of weak vdW forces, causing e.g. a pronounced contraction of the second solvation shell upon cooling that induces the density maximum.},

Traditionally, the SIE has been formulated as a one-electron problem, which has been addressed in several recent functionals. However, these recent one-electron SIE-free functionals, while greatly improving the description of thermochemistry and reaction barriers in general, still exhibit many of the difficulties associated with SIE. Thus we emphasize the need to surpass this limit and shed light on the many-electron SIE. After identifying the sufficient condition for functionals to be free from SIE, we focus on the symptoms and investigate the performance of most popular functionals. We show that these functionals suffer from many-electron SIE. Finally, we give a SIE classification of density functionals.},

However, in practice the largest outer time step possible is limited not by the physical forces but by resonances between the fast and slow modes. In this paper we show that this problem can be alleviated by using a simple colored noise thermostatting scheme which selectively targets the high frequency modes in the system. For two sample problems, flexible water and solvated alanine dipeptide, we demonstrate that this allows the use of large outer time steps while still obtaining accurate sampling and minimizing the perturbation of the dynamics. Furthermore, this approach is shown to be comparable to constraining fast motions, thus providing an alternative to molecular dynamics with constraints.},

  abstract = {Four methods for calculation of the classical free energy of crystalline systems are compared with respect to their efficiency and accuracy. Two of the methods involve thermodynamic integration along an unphysical path ($\lambda$ integration, $\lambda$I), and two involve integration in temperature from the low-temperature harmonic limit (T integration, TI). Specifically, the methods considered are (1) Frenkel−Ladd integration from a noninteracting Einstein crystal reference (ECR-$\lambda$I); (2) conventional integration in temperature (Conv- TI); (3) integration from an interacting quasi-harmonic reference (QHR-$\lambda$I); and (4) temperature integration using harmonically mapped averaging to evaluate the integrand (HMA-TI). The latter two methods are “harmonically assisted”, meaning that they exploit the harmonic nature of the crystal to greatly reduce fluctuations in the relevant averages. This feature allows them to deliver a result of much higher precision for a given computational effort, compared to ECR-$\lambda$I and Conv-TI, and with no less accuracy. Regarding the harmonically assisted methods, HMA-TI has several advantages over QHR-$\lambda$I with respect to the simplicity of the integration path (which promotes a more accurate result), ease of implementation, and usefulness of the data recorded along the integration path.},

Building on the accuracy of the MB-pol many-body PEF, we investigate here the performance of permutationally invariant polynomials, neural networks, and Gaussian approximation potentials in representing water two-body and three-body interaction energies, denoting the resulting potentials PIP-MB-pol, BPNN-MB-pol, and GAP-MB-pol, respectively. Our analysis shows that all three analytical representations exhibit similar levels of accuracy in reproducing both two-body and three-body reference data as well as interaction energies of small water clusters obtained from calculations carried out at the coupled cluster level of theory, the current gold standard for chemical accuracy. These results demonstrate the synergy between interatomic potentials formulated in terms of a many-body expansion, such as MB-pol, that are physically sound and transferable, and machine-learning techniques that provide a flexible framework to approximate the short-range interaction energy terms.},

This includes the stationary distribution, the metastable states, and state-to-state transition rates. Here, we present a variational approach for computing these dominant eigenvalues and eigenvectors. This approach is analogous to the variational approach used for computing stationary states in quantum mechanics. A corresponding method of linear variation is formulated. It is shown that the matrices needed for the linear variation method are correlation matrices that can be estimated from simple MD simulations for a given basis set. The method proposed here is thus to first define a basis set able to capture the relevant conformational transitions, then compute the respective correlation matrices, and then to compute their dominant eigenvalues and eigenvectors, thus obtaining the key ingredients of the slow kinetics.},

  abstract = {Diffusion of vacancies and impurities in metals is important in many processes occurring in structural materials. This diffusion often takes place in the presence of spatially rapidly varying stresses. Diffusion under stress is frequently modelled by local approximations to the vacancy formation and diffusion activation enthalpies which are linear in the stress, in order to account for its dependence on the local stress state and its gradient. Here, more accurate local approximations to the vacancy formation and diffusion activation enthalpies, and the simulation methods needed to implement them, are introduced. The accuracy of both these approximations and the linear approximations are assessed via comparison to full atomistic studies for the problem of vacancies around a Lomer dislocation in Aluminium. Results show that the local and linear approximations for the vacancy formation enthalpy and diffusion activation enthalpy are accurate to within 0.05 eV outside a radius of about 13 Angstrom (local) and 17 Angstrom (linear) from the centre of the dislocation core or, more generally, for a strain gradient of roughly up to 6 x 10(6) m(-1) and 3 x 10(6) m(-1), respectively. These results provide a basis for the development of multiscale models of diffusion under highly non-uniform stress.},

  abstract = {Successive parameterizations of the GROMOS force field have been used successfully to simulate biomolecular systems over a long period of time. The continuing expansion of computational power with time makes it possible to compute ever more properties for an increasing variety of molecular systems with greater precision. This has led to recurrent parameterizations of the GROMOS force field all aimed at achieving better agreement with experimental data. Here we report the results of the latest, extensive reparameterization of the GROMOS force field. In contrast to the parameterization of other biomolecular force fields, this parameterization of the GROMOS force field is based primarily on reproducing the free enthalpies of hydration and apolar solvation for a range of compounds. This approach was chosen because the relative free enthalpy of solvation between polar and apolar environments is a key property in many biomolecular processes of interest, such as protein folding, biomolecular association, membrane formation, and transport over membranes. The newest parameter sets, 53A5 and 53A6, were optimized by first fitting to reproduce the thermodynamic properties of pure liquids of a range of small polar molecules and the solvation free enthalpies of amino acid analogs in cyclohexane (53A5). The partial charges were then adjusted to reproduce the hydration free enthalpies in water (53A6). Both parameter sets are fully documented, and the differences between these and previous parameter sets are discussed.},

  abstract = {An Al-Si solid-state phase diagram is studied using first-principles electronic structure calculations of formation enthalpies and quasiharmonic vibrational free energies. The harmonic vibrational entropy of formation of a Si impurity in fcc Al is predicted to be Delta S-vib = +2.6 k(B) per Si atom, resulting in more than a ten-fold increase in the calculated solubility. Thermal expansion is found to further increase the maximum solubility at T = 850 K by approximately 55{\%}. Surprisingly, when vibrational effects are included, the widely used local-density approximation (LDA) performs poorly in reproducing the experimental solvus boundary, which is overestimated by a factor of ten. This failure is attributed to the neglect of corrections to the calculated LDA impurity enthalpy Delta H stemming from the inhomogeneity of the electronic charge density. These corrections tend to favour the four-fold coordinated diamond structure over the twelve-fold coordinated fcc solid-solution phase. The generalized-gradient approximation (GGA) is found to remove most of the discrepancy between the experimental and calculated Delta H, giving a good agreement with the experimental Al-Si phase diagram.},

Through a direct comparison with the results obtained from mixed quantum-classical calculations, it is shown that centroid molecular dynamics provides accurate vibrational shifts and lineshapes when the intramolecular bond stretching vibrations are described by a physically reasonable anharmonic potential.

  abstract = {The path-integral molecular dynamics and centroid molecular dynamics methods have been applied to investigate the behavior of liquid water at ambient conditions starting from a recently developed simple point charge/flexible (SPC/Fw) model. Several quantum structural, thermodynamic, and dynamical properties have been computed and compared to the corresponding classical values, as well as to the available experimental data. The path-integral molecular dynamics simulations show that the inclusion of quantum effects results in a less structured liquid with a reduced amount of hydrogen bonding in comparison to its classical analog. The nuclear quantization also leads to a smaller dielectric constant and a larger diffusion coefficient relative to the corresponding classical values. Collective and single molecule time correlation functions show a faster decay than their classical counterparts. Good agreement with the experimental measurements in the low-frequency region is obtained for the quantum infrared spectrum, which also shows a higher intensity and a redshift relative to its classical analog. A modification of the original parametrization of the SPC/Fw model is suggested and tested in order to construct an accurate quantum model, called q-SPC/Fw, for liquid water. The quantum results for several thermodynamic and dynamical properties computed with the new model are shown to be in a significantly better agreement with the experimental data. Finally, a force-matching approach was applied to the q-SPC/Fw model to derive an effective quantum force field for liquid water in which the effects due to the nuclear quantization are explicitly distinguished from those due to the underlying molecular interactions. Thermodynamic and dynamical properties computed using standard classical simulations with this effective quantum potential are found in excellent agreement with those obtained from significantly more computationally demanding full centroid molecular dynamics simulations. The present results suggest that the inclusion of nuclear quantum effects into an empirical model for water enhances the ability of such model to faithfully represent experimental data, presumably through an increased ability of the model itself to capture realistic physical effects.},

The results show that quantum effects are not negligible even at relatively high temperatures, and their inclusion in simulations with the TTM2.1-F water model is necessary to achieve a more accurate description of the liquid properties. Comparison with the results reported in the literature for empirical, nonpolarizable force fields demonstrates that the effects of the nuclear quantization on the dielectric constant are dependent in part on how the electronic polarization is described in the underlying water model, while comparison with other ab initio-based force fields shows that the TTM2.1-F model provides an overall accurate description of liquid water. Analysis of the isotope effect on the dynamical properties does not display significant temperature dependence. This suggests that the contribution of quantum tunneling, which has been proposed as a possible cause for the different orientational dynamics observed for the HDO:H(2)O and HDO:D(2)O systems, appears to be small.},

A comparison between the calculated spectra and the available experimental data yields an overall good agreement, indicating the accuracy of the present simulation approach in describing the properties of liquid water under ambient conditions.

  abstract  = {Liquid water's isothermal compressibility and isobaric heat capacity, and the magnitude of its thermal expansion coefficient, increase sharply on cooling below the equilibrium freezing point. Many experimental, theoretical and computational studies have sought to understand the molecular origin and implications of this anomalous behaviour. Of the different theoretical scenarios put forward, one posits the existence of a first-order phase transition that involves two forms of liquid water and terminates at a critical point located at deeply supercooled conditions. Some experimental evidence is consistent with this hypothesis, but no definitive proof of a liquid-liquid transition in water has been obtained to date: rapid ice crystallization has so far prevented decisive measurements on deeply supercooled water, although this challenge has been overcome recently. Computer simulations are therefore crucial for exploring water's structure and behaviour in this regime, and have shown that some water models exhibit liquid-liquid transitions and others do not. However, recent work has argued that the liquid-liquid transition has been mistakenly interpreted, and is in fact a liquid-crystal transition in all atomistic models of water. Here we show, by studying the liquid-liquid transition in the ST2 model of water with the use of six advanced sampling methods to compute the free-energy surface, that two metastable liquid phases and a stable crystal phase exist at the same deeply supercooled thermodynamic condition, and that the transition between the two liquids satisfies the thermodynamic criteria of a first-order transition. We follow the rearrangement of water's coordination shell and topological ring structure along a thermodynamically reversible path from the low-density liquid to cubic ice. We also show that the system fluctuates freely between the two liquid phases rather than crystallizing. These findings provide unambiguous evidence for a liquid-liquid transition in the ST2 model of water, and point to the separation of time scales between crystallization and relaxation as being crucial for enabling it.},

  abstract      = {An essential parameter for crystal growth is the kinetic coefficient given by the proportionality between supercooling and average growth velocity. Here, we show that this coefficient can be computed in a single equilibrium simulation using the interface pinning method where two-phase configurations are stabilized by adding a spring-like bias field coupling to an order-parameter that discriminates between the two phases. Crystal growth is a Smoluchowski process and the crystal growth rate can, therefore, be computed from the terminal exponential relaxation of the order parameter. The approach is investigated in detail for the Lennard-Jones model. We find that the kinetic coefficient scales as the inverse square-root of temperature along the high temperature part of the melting line. The practical usability of the method is demonstrated by computing the kinetic coefficient of the elements Na and Si from first principles. A generalized version of the method may be used for computing the rates of crystal nucleation or other rare events.},

The effects of quantization on the lattice vibrations, associated with the molecular translations and librations, are also reported. Comparison of quantum and classical simulation results indicates that shifts in the average potential energy are equivalent to rising the temperature about 80 K and are therefore non-negligible. The energy shifts due to quantization and the quantum mechanical uncertainties observed in ice are smaller than the values previously reported for liquid water.

The methods are based on the Takahashi-Imada and Susuki decompositions of the Boltzmann operator. The methods introduced improve the averages of the estimators by using the classical forces needed to carry out the dynamics to construct a posteriori weighting factors for standard path integral molecular dynamics. The new approaches are straightforward to implement in existing path integral codes and carry no significant overhead. The Suzuki higher order factorization was also used to improve the end-to-end distance estimator in open path integral molecular dynamics. The new schemes are tested in various model systems, including an ab initio path integral molecular dynamics calculation on the hydrogen molecule and a quantum water model. The proposed algorithms have potential utility for reducing the cost of path integral molecular dynamics calculations of bulk systems.},

Enhanced sampling in ring-polymer molecular dynamics (RPMD) is achieved by first performing an equilibrium path integral calculation and then launching RPMD trajectories from selected, stochastically independent equilibrium configurations. It is shown that this approach converges more rapidly than periodic resampling of velocities from a single long RPMD run. Dynamical quantities obtained from RPMD and centroid molecular dynamics (CMD) are compared to exact results for a variety of model systems. Fully converged results for correlations functions are presented for several one dimensional systems and para-hydrogen near its triple point using an improved sampling technique. Our results indicate that CMD shows very similar performance to RPMD. The quality of each method is further assessed via a new chi(2) descriptor constructed by transforming approximate real-time correlation functions from CMD and RPMD trajectories to imaginary time and comparing these to numerically exact imaginary time correlation functions. For para-hydrogen near its triple point, it is found that adiabatic CMD and RPMD both have similar chi(2) error.},

  abstract = {The solvation and transport properties of the sulfonate-hydronium ion pair have been studied in hydrated Nafion through molecular dynamics simulation. Explicit proton and charge delocalization of the excess proton transport, via the Grotthuss hopping mechanism, were treated using the self-consistent multistate empirical valence bond (SCI-MS-EVB) method. The nature of the sulfonate-hydronium ion pair was characterized through analysis of free-energy profiles. It was found that, in general, the excess proton is solvated between two water molecules of a Zundel moiety while in the contact ion pair position, but then it transitions to an Eigen-like configuration in the solvent-separated pair position. Furthermore, the positive charge associated with the excess proton passes between the contact and solvent-separated ion pair positions through the Grotthuss mechanism rather than simple vehicular diffusion. The total proton diffusion was decomposed into vehicular and Grotthuss components and were found to be of the same relative magnitude, but with a strong negative correlation resulting in a smaller overall diffusion. Correlated motions between the ion pair were examined through the distinct portion of the van Hove correlation function, and a characteristic time scale of approximately 425 ps was observed. Additionally, the association of the hydrated proton with the hydrophobic polymer backbone suggests its amphiphile-like behavior (see Acc. Chem. Res. 2006, 39, 143; Phys. Rev. 1954, 95, 249; J. Chem.

Computational studies of organic systems are frequently limited to static pictures that closely align with textbook style presentations of reaction mechanisms and isomerization processes. Of course, in reality chemical systems are dynamic entities where a multitude of molecular conformations exists on incredibly complex potential energy surfaces (PES). Here, we borrow a computational technique originally conceived to be used in the context of biological simulations, together with empirical force fields, and apply it to organic chemical problems. Replica-exchange molecular dynamics (REMD) permits thorough exploration of the PES. We combined REMD with density functional tight binding (DFTB), thereby establishing the level of accuracy necessary to analyze small molecular systems. Through the study of four prototypical problems: isomer identification, reaction mechanisms, temperature-dependent rotational processes, and catalysis, we reveal new insights and chemistry that likely would be missed using static electronic structure computations. The REMD-DFTB methodology at the heart of this study is powered by i-PI, which efficiently handles the interface between the DFTB and REMD codes.},

Soc. 2006, 128, 13435] we introduce a powerful methodology that allows the parallel reconstruction of the free energy of a system in a virtually unlimited number of variables. Multiple metadynamics simulations of the same system at the same temperature are performed, biasing each replica with a time-dependent potential constructed in a different set of collective variables. Exchanges between the bias potentials in the different variables are periodically allowed according to a replica exchange scheme. Due to the efficaciously multidimensional nature of the bias the method allows exploring complex free energy landscapes with high efficiency. The usefulness of the method is demonstrated by performing an atomistic simulation in explicit solvent of the folding of a Triptophane cage miniprotein. It is shown that the folding free energy landscape can be fully characterized starting from an extended conformation with use of only 40 ns of simulation on 8 replicas.},

Extending to amorphous phases and liquids which lack the discrete symmetries, the problem becomes even more difficult, involving subtle topological differences at medium range that, however, are crucial to the physico-chemical and spectroscopic properties of the corresponding materials. Typically, system-tailored order parameters are devised, like global or local symmetry indicators, ring populations, etc. We show that a recently introduced metric provides a simple and general solution to this intricate problem. In particular, we demonstrate that a map can be traced displaying distances among water phases, including crystalline as well as amorphous states and the liquid, consistently with experimental knowledge in terms of phase diagram, structural features, and preparation routes.},

This process has been investigated via experiments and simulations due to its potential relevance in the H release mechanism in sodium alanates, prototypical materials for solid state hydrogen storage. Previous computational studies, which used density functional methods for the electronic structure, were restricted to a classical treatment of the nuclear degrees of freedom. We show that, although they do not change the qualitative picture of the process, nuclear quantum effects reduce the free energy barrier height by about 18{\%} with respect to the classical calculation improving agreement with available neutron scattering data.},

  abstract = {Molecular force fields have been approaching a generational transition over the past several years, moving away from well-established and well-tuned, but intrinsically limited, fixed point charge models toward more intricate and expensive polarizable models that should allow more accurate description of molecular properties. The recently introduced AMOEBA force field is a leading publicly available example of this next generation of theoretical model, but to date, it has only received relatively limited validation, which we address here. We show that the AMOEBA force field is in fact a significant improvement over fixed charge models for small molecule structural and thermodynamic observables in particular, although further fine-tuning is necessary to describe solvation free energies of drug-like small molecules, dynamical properties away from ambient conditions, and possible improvements in aromatic interactions. State of the art electronic structure calculations reveal generally very good agreement with AMOEBA for demanding problems such as relative conformational energies of the alanine tetrapeptide and isomers of water sulfate complexes. AMOEBA is shown to be especially successful on protein-ligand binding and computational X-ray crystallography where polarization and accurate electrostatics are critical.},

By only considering two-center integrals the Hamiltonian and overlap matrix elements are calculated out of suitable input densities and potentials rather than 6tted to experimental data. We can derive analytical functions for the C-C, C-H, and H-H Hamiltonian and overlap matrix elements. The usual short-range repul-sive potential appearing in most TB models is fitted to self-consistent calculations performed within the LDA. The calculation of forces is easy and allow's an application of the method to molecular-dynamics simulations. Despite its extreme simplicity, the method is transferable to complex carbon and hydrocarbon systems. The determination of equilibrium geometries, total energies, and vibra-tional modes of carbon clusters, hydrocarbon molecules, and solid-state modifications of carbon yield results showing an overall good agreement with more sophisticated methods.},

The law, called the incomplete beta function law, is valid in the limit that the two temperatures involved in swaps are close to one another. An empirical version of the law, which involves the heat capacity of the system, is developed and tested on a Lennard-Jones cluster. We argue that the best initial guess for the distribution of intermediate temperatures for parallel tempering is a geometric progression and we also propose a technique for the computation of optimal temperature schedules. Finally, we demonstrate that the swap efficiency of the parallel tempering method for condensed-phase systems decreases naturally to zero at least as fast as the inverse square root of the dimensionality of the physical system.},

Under the hypothesis that the correlation between successive exchanges is negligible, we propose a technique for the computation of the effective fraction, a technique that relies solely on the values of the acceptance probabilities obtained at the end of the simulation. The effective fraction is then utilized for the study of the efficiency of a popular swapping scheme in the context of parallel tempering in the canonical ensemble. For large dimensional oscillators, we show that the swapping probability that minimizes the computational effort is 38.74{\%}. By studying the parallel tempering swapping efficiency for a 13-atom Lennard-Jones cluster, we argue that the value of 38.74{\%} remains roughly the optimal probability for most systems with continuous distributions that are likely to be encountered in practice.},

However, other quantities besides the volume could play a role in the free energy of cluster formation, and this will in turn affect the nucleation barrier and the shape of the nucleus. Here we exploit our recently introduced mesoscopic theory of nucleation to compute the free energy cost of a nearly spherical cluster of volume V and a fluctuating surface area A, whereby the maximum of $\Delta$$\Omega$(V) is replaced by a saddle point in $\Delta$$\Omega$(V, A). Compared to the simpler theory based on volume only, the barrier height of $\Delta$$\Omega$(V, A) at the transition state is systematically larger by a few kBT. More importantly, we show that, depending on the physical situation, the most probable shape of the nucleus may be highly non-spherical, even when the surface tension and stiffness of the model are isotropic. Interestingly, these shape fluctuations do not influence or modify the standard Classical Nucleation Theory manner of extracting the interface tension from the logarithm of the nucleation rate near coexistence.},

  abstract = {The phenomenon of polymorphism, the ability of a molecule to adopt more than one crystal structure, is a well-established property of crystalline solids. The possible variations in physical properties between polymorphs make the reliable reproduction of a crystalline form essential for all research using organic materials, as well as quality control in manufacture. Thus, the last two decades have seen both an increase in interest in polymorphism and the availability of the computer power needed to make the computational prediction of organic crystal structures a practical possibility. In the past decade, researchers have made considerable improvements in the theoretical basis for calculating the sets of structures that are within the energy range of possible polymorphism, called crystal energy landscapes. It is common to find that a molecule has a wide variety of ways of packing with lattice energy within a few kilojoules per mole of the most stable structure. However, as we develop methods to search for and characterize "all" solid forms, it is also now usual for polymorphs and solvates to be found. Thus, the computed crystal energy landscape reflects and to an increasing extent "predicts" the emerging complexity of the solid state observed for many organic molecules. This Account will discuss the ways in which the calculation of the crystal energy landscape of a molecule can be used as a complementary technique to solid form screening for polymorphs. Current methods can predict the known crystal structure, even under "blind test" conditions, but such successes are generally restricted to those structures that are the most stable over a wide range of thermodynamic conditions. The other low-energy structures can be alternative polymorphs, which have sometimes been found in later experimental studies. Examining the computed structures reveals the various compromises between close packing, hydrogen bonding, and pi-pi stacking that can result in energetically feasible structures. Indeed, we have observed that systems with many almost equi-energetic structures that contain a common interchangeable motif correlate with a tendency to disorder and problems with control of the crystallization product. Thus, contrasting the computed crystal energy landscape with the known crystal structures of a given molecule provides a valuable complement to solid form screening, and the examination of the low-energy structures often leads to a rationalization of the forms found.},

  abstract      = {Markov state models of molecular kinetics (MSMs), in which the long-time statistical dynamics of a molecule is approximated by a Markov chain on a discrete partition of configuration space, have seen widespread use in recent years. This approach has many appealing characteristics compared to straightforward molecular dynamics simulation and analysis, including the potential to mitigate the sampling problem by extracting long-time kinetic information from short trajectories and the ability to straightforwardly calculate expectation values and statistical uncertainties of various stationary and dynamical molecular observables. In this paper, we summarize the current state of the art in generation and validation of MSMs and give some important new results. We describe an upper bound for the approximation error made by modeling molecular dynamics with a MSM and we show that this error can be made arbitrarily small with surprisingly little effort. In contrast to previous practice, it becomes clear that the best MSM is not obtained by the most metastable discretization, but the MSM can be much improved if non-metastable states are introduced near the transition states. Moreover, we show that it is not necessary to resolve all slow processes by the state space partitioning, but individual dynamical processes of interest can be resolved separately. We also present an efficient estimator for reversible transition matrices and a robust test to validate that a MSM reproduces the kinetics of the molecular dynamics data.},

Using two different freezing transitions (hard spheres and NaCl) as test cases, we first observe that the interface-free-energy estimates based on CNT are generally in error. As successive refinements of nucleation-barrier theory, we consider corrections due to a nonsharp solid-liquid interface and to a nonspherical cluster shape. Extensive calculations for the Ising model show that corrections due to a nonsharp and thermally fluctuating interface account for the barrier shape with excellent accuracy. The experimental solid nucleation rates that are measured in colloids are better accounted for by these non-CNT terms, whose effect appears to be crucial in the interpretation of data and in the extraction of the interface tension from them.},

Free energy differences between isotopes are related to the dependence of their kinetic energy on the isotope mass. The water simulations were performed by using the q-TIP4P/F model, a point charge empirical potential that includes molecular flexibility and anharmonicity in the OH stretch of the water molecule. The reported melting temperature at ambient pressure of this model (T=251 K) increases by 6.5±0.5 and 8.2±0.5 K upon isotopic substitution of hydrogen by deuterium and tritium, respectively. These temperature shifts are larger than the experimental ones (3.8 and 4.5 K, respectively). In the classical limit, the melting temperature is nearly the same as that for tritiated ice. This unexpected behavior is rationalized by the coupling between intermolecular interactions and molecular flexibility. This coupling makes the kinetic energy of the OH stretching modes larger in the liquid than in the solid phase. However, the opposite behavior is found for intramolecular modes, which display larger kinetic energy in ice than in liquid water.},

Functional forms, potential surface coupling terms, and parameterization strategies for the Approximate Pair Theory (APT), a next generation reactive force field model, are described. The APT model has been developed to correct a number of limitations in current reactive force field models as well as providing a foundation for a next generation QM–MM model. Chemical bonding concepts are used to develop fully dissociative bond stretch, bend, torsion, and inversion valence terms. Quantum mechanics also provides functional forms for potential surface coupling terms that permit a general description of reactivity from hydrogen bonding, through non-classical carbocations and cracking, to olefin polymerization, oxidation, and metathesis. Van der Waals, electrostatic, and metallic bonding models also derive from quantum mechanical resonance. Finally, Pauli Principle-based orthogonality provides a way to electrostatically couple the QM and MM portions of a QM–MM model that will support arbitrarily large basis sets.},

Calculations of metastable phase equilibria in these alloys are virtually nonexistent due to the lack of quantitative information on the thermodynamics of the precipitate phases. We have undertaken an extensive, systematic first-principles study of energetics of all the reported precipitate phases of Al-Mg-Si-(Cu) alloys, using density functional-based calculations in both the local density and generalized gradient approximations. Our calculations help clarify the energetics of the metastable precipitate phases, and in certain cases, provide insight into the compositional changes of precipitates during aging. In addition to energetics, we also examine the relative volumes of the various phases, and discuss cases of significant deviation from that of the solid solution. ?? 2004 Acta Materialia Inc.

Since the two observed solid forms of aspirin are degenerate in terms of lattice energy, kinetic effects have been suggested to determine the metastability of the less abundant form II. Here, first-principles calculations provide an alternative explanation based on free-energy differences at room temperature. The explicit consideration of many-body van der Waals interactions in the free energy demonstrates that the stability of the most abundant form of aspirin is due to a subtle coupling between collective electronic fluctuations and quantized lattice vibrations. In addition, a systematic analysis of the elastic properties of the two forms of aspirin rules out mechanical instability of form II as making it metastable.},

The short ranged parts define a minimal reference network model that captures very well the structure of the local hydrogen bond network in bulk water while ignoring effects of the remaining long ranged interactions. This deconstruction can provide insight into the different roles that the local hydrogen bond network, dispersion forces, and long ranged dipolar interactions play in determining a variety of properties of SPC/E and related classical models of water. Here we focus on the anomalous behavior of the internal pressure and the temperature dependence of the density of bulk water. We further utilize these short ranged models along with local molecular field theory to quantify the influence of these interactions on the structure of hydrophobic interfaces and the crossover from small to large scale hydration behavior. The implications of our findings for theories of hydrophobicity and possible refinements of classical water models are also discussed.},

  abstract = {We demonstrate that the ring-polymer molecular dynamics (RPMD) method is equivalent to an automated and approximate implementation of the "Im F" version of semiclassical instanton theory when used to calculate reaction rates in the deep-tunneling regime. This explains why the RPMD method is often reliable in this regime and also shows how it can be systematically improved. The geometry of the beads at the transition state on the ring-polymer potential surface describes a finite-difference approximation to the "instanton" trajectory (a periodic orbit in imaginary time beta variant Planck's over 2pi on the inverted potential surface). The deep-tunneling RPMD rate is an approximation to the rate obtained by applying classical transition-state theory (TST) in ring-polymer phase-space using the optimal dividing surface; this TST rate is in turn an approximation to a free-energy version of the Im F instanton rate. The optimal dividing surface is in general a function of several modes of the ring polymer, which explains why centroid-based quantum-TSTs break down at low temperatures for asymmetric reaction barriers. Numerical tests on one-dimensional models show that the RPMD rate tends to overestimate deep-tunneling rates for asymmetric barriers and underestimate them for symmetric barriers, and we explain that this is likely to be a general trend. The ability of the RPMD method to give a dividing-surface-independent rate in the deep-tunneling regime is shown to be a consequence of setting the bead-masses equal to the physical mass.},

  abstract = {Protein adhesion plays a major role in determining the biocompatibility of materials. The first stage of implant integration is the adhesion of protein followed by cell attachment. Surface modification of implants (surface chemistry and topography) to induce and control protein and cell adhesion is currently of great interest. This communication presents data on protein adsorption (bovine serum albumin and fibrinogen) onto model hydrophobic (CH(3)) and hydrophilic (OH) surfaces, investigated using a quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) and grazing angle infrared spectroscopy. Our data suggest that albumin undergoes adsorption via a single step whereas fibrinogen adsorption is a more complex, multistage process. Albumin has a stronger affinity toward the CH(3) compared to OH terminated surface. In contrast, fibrinogen adheres more rapidly to both surfaces, having a slightly higher affinity toward the hydrophobic surface. Conformational assessment of the adsorbed proteins by grazing angle infrared spectroscopy (GA-FTIR) shows that after an initial 1 h incubation few further time-dependent changes are observed. Both proteins exhibited a less organized secondary structure upon adsorption onto a hydrophobic surface than onto a hydrophilic surface, with the effect observed greatest for albumin. This study demonstrates the ability of simple tailor-made monochemical surfaces to influence binding rates and conformation of bound proteins through protein-surface interactions. Current interest in biocompatible materials has focused on surface modifications to induce rapid healing, both of implants and for wound care products. This effect may also be of significance at the next stage of implant integration, as cell adhesion occurs through the surface protein layer.},

We are able to reproduce well the experimental results, however we do not find evidence of a covalent nature of the hydrogen bond. In fact our analysis shows that, although the wave functions in ice I-h have a quantum-mechanical, multicenter character, this gives rise to an antibonding, repulsive interaction between neighboring water molecules. Application to our technique to other, nonhydrogen bonded systems, and analysis of the corresponding Compton scattering profile anisotropy, gives further support to our interpretation.

  abstract = {Two of the most successful methods that are presently available for simulating the quantum dynamics of condensed phase systems are centroid molecular dynamics (CMD) and ring polymer molecular dynamics (RPMD). Despite their conceptual differences, practical implementations of these methods differ in just two respects: the choice of the Parrinello-Rahman mass matrix and whether or not a thermostat is applied to the internal modes of the ring polymer during the dynamics. Here, we explore a method which is halfway between the two approximations: we keep the path integral bead masses equal to the physical particle masses but attach a Langevin thermostat to the internal modes of the ring polymer during the dynamics. We justify this by showing analytically that the inclusion of an internal mode thermostat does not affect any of the established features of RPMD: thermostatted RPMD is equally valid with respect to everything that has actually been proven about the method as RPMD itself. In particular, because of the choice of bead masses, the resulting method is still optimum in the short-time limit, and the transition state approximation to its reaction rate theory remains closely related to the semiclassical instanton approximation in the deep quantum tunneling regime. In effect, there is a continuous family of methods with these properties, parameterised by the strength of the Langevin friction. Here, we explore numerically how the approximation to quantum dynamics depends on this friction, with a particular emphasis on vibrational spectroscopy. We find that a broad range of frictions approaching optimal damping give similar results, and that these results are immune to both the resonance problem of RPMD and the curvature problem of CMD.},

  abstract = {{\"{i}}¿½ 2014 AIP Publishing LLC. Including quantum mechanical effects on the dynamics of nuclei in the condensed phase is challenging, because the complexity of exact methods grows exponentially with the number of quantum degrees of freedom. Efforts to circumvent these limitations can be traced down to two approaches: methods that treat a small subset of the degrees of freedom with rigorous quantum mechanics, considering the rest of the system as a static or classical environment, and methods that treat the whole system quantum mechanically, but using approximate dynamics. Here, we perform a systematic comparison between these two philosophies for the description of quantum effects in vibrational spectroscopy, taking the Embedded Local Monomer model and a mixed quantum-classical model as representatives of the first family of methods, and centroid molecular dynamics and thermostatted ring polymer molecular dynamics as examples of the latter. We use as benchmarks D 2 O doped with HOD and pure H 2 O at three distinct thermodynamic state points (ice Ih at 150 K, and the liquid at 300 K and 600 K), modeled with the simple q-TIP4P/F potential energy and dipole moment surfaces. With few exceptions the different techniques yield IR absorption frequencies that are consistent with one another within a few tens of cm -1 . Comparison with classical molecular dynamics demonstrates the importance of nuclear quantum effects up to the highest temperature, and a detailed discussion of the discrepancies between the various methods let us draw some (circumstantial) conclusions about the impact of the very different approximations that underlie them. Such cross validation between radically different approaches could indicate a way forward to further improve the state of the art in simulations of condensed-phase quantum dynamics.},

Here we focus on two aspects of this process that are often disregarded because of their high computational cost: the use of first-principles potential energy surfaces and the treatment of the nuclei as quantum particles. We consider proton and hydroxide ions in finite water wires using density functional theory augmented with an apolar cylindrical confining potential.

  abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 American Physical Society. Molecular crystals often exist in multiple competing polymorphs, showing significantly different physicochemical properties. Computational crystal structure prediction is key to interpret and guide the search for the most stable or useful form, a real challenge due to the combinatorial search space, and the complex interplay of subtle effects that work together to determine the relative stability of different structures. Here we take a comprehensive approach based on different flavors of thermodynamic integration in order to estimate all contributions to the free energies of these systems with density-functional theory, including the oft-neglected anharmonic contributions and nuclear quantum effects. We take the two main stable forms of paracetamol as a paradigmatic example. We find that anharmonic contributions, different descriptions of van der Waals interactions, and nuclear quantum effects all matter to quantitatively determine the stability of different phases. Our analysis highlights the many challenges inherent in the development of a quantitative and predictive framework to model molecular crystals. However, it also indicates which of the components of the free energy can benefit from a cancellation of errors that can redeem the predictive power of approximate models, and suggests simple steps that could be taken to improve the reliability of ab initio crystal structure prediction.},

Generalized Langevin Equation (GLE) thermostats have been used very effectively as a tool to manipulate and optimize the sampling of thermodynamic ensembles and the associated static properties. Here we show that a similar, exquisite level of control can be achieved for the dynamical properties computed from thermostatted trajectories. We develop quantitative measures of the disturbance induced by the GLE to the Hamiltonian dynamics of a harmonic oscillator, and show that these analytical results accurately predict the behavior of strongly anharmonic systems. We also show that it is possible to correct, to a significant extent, the effects of the GLE term onto the corresponding microcanonical dynamics, which puts on more solid grounds the use of non-equilibrium Langevin dynamics to approximate quantum nuclear effects and could help improve the prediction of dynamical quantities from techniques that use a Langevin term to stabilize dynamics. Finally we address the use of thermostats in the context of approximate path-integral-based models of quantum nuclear dynamics. We demonstrate that a custom-tailored GLE can alleviate some of the artifacts associated with these techniques, improving the quality of results for the modeling of vibrational dynamics of molecules, liquids, and solids.},

A binned version of the sample point estimator is developed that, for various situations in low to moderate dimensions, exhibits less error (MISE) than the fixed bandwidth estimator and the balloon estimator. A practical implementation of the sample point estimator is shown through simulation and example to do a better job at reconstructing features of the underlying density than fixed bandwidth estimators. Computational details, including parameterization of the smoothing matrix, are discussed throughout. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

For strongly hydrogen-bonded systems, such as liquid water, non-Condon effects are large. That is, the bond dipole derivative of an OH stretch depends strongly on its hydrogen-bonding environment. Previous calculations of nonlinear vibrational spectroscopy in liquids have not included these non-Condon effects. We find that for water, inclusion of these effects is important for an accurate calculation of, for example, homodyned and heterodyned three-pulse echoes. Such echo experiments have been "inverted" to obtain the OH stretch frequency time-correlation function, but by necessity the Condon and other approximations are made in this inversion procedure. Our conclusion is that for water, primarily because of strong non-Condon effects, this inversion may not lead to the correct frequency time-correlation function. Nevertheless, one can still make comparison between theory and experiment by calculating the experimental echo observables themselves.},

This includes all possible perovskite and anti-perovskite crystals that can be generated with elements from hydrogen to bismuth, and neglecting rare gases and lanthanides. Incidentally, these calculations already reveal a large number of systems (around 500) that are thermodynamically stable, but that are not present in crystal structure databases. Moreover, some of these phases have unconventional compositions and define completely new families of perovskites. This data set is then used to train and test a series of machine learning algorithms to predict the energy distance to the convex hull of stability. In particular, we study the performance of ridge regression, random forests, extremely randomized trees (including adaptive boosting), and neural ...},

All force fields investigated reproduce the main features of the experimental SAXS structure factor S(q), including the minimum at small q, and the recent TIP4P/2005 parametrization yields almost quantitative agreement. As local structural order parameters we consider the tetrahedrality and the number of hydrogen bonds and calculate all pure and mixed spatial two-point correlation functions. Except for the density-density correlation function, there are only weak features present in all other correlation functions, showing that the tendency to form structural clusters is much weaker than the well-known tendency of water to form density clusters (i.e., spatially correlated regions where the density deviates from the mean). In particular, there are only small spatial correlations between local density and structural fluctuations, suggesting that features in density-density correlations (such as measured by the structure factor) are not straightforwardly related to spatial correlations of structure in liquid water.},

  abstract  = {Water has a number of anomalous physical properties, and some of these become drastically enhanced on supercooling below the freezing point. Particular interest has focused on thermodynamic response functions that can be described using a normal component and an anomalous component that seems to diverge at about 228 kelvin (refs 1-3). This has prompted debate about conflicting theories that aim to explain many of the anomalous thermodynamic properties of water. One popular theory attributes the divergence to a phase transition between two forms of liquid water occurring in the 'no man's land' that lies below the homogeneous ice nucleation temperature (TH) at approximately 232 kelvin and above about 160 kelvin, and where rapid ice crystallization has prevented any measurements of the bulk liquid phase. In fact, the reliable determination of the structure of liquid water typically requires temperatures above about 250 kelvin. Water crystallization has been inhibited by using nanoconfinement, nanodroplets and association with biomolecules to give liquid samples at temperatures below TH, but such measurements rely on nanoscopic volumes of water where the interaction with the confining surfaces makes the relevance to bulk water unclear. Here we demonstrate that femtosecond X-ray laser pulses can be used to probe the structure of liquid water in micrometre-sized droplets that have been evaporatively cooled below TH. We find experimental evidence for the existence of metastable bulk liquid water down to temperatures of 227(-1)(+2) kelvin in the previously largely unexplored no man's land. We observe a continuous and accelerating increase in structural ordering on supercooling to approximately 229 kelvin, where the number of droplets containing ice crystals increases rapidly. But a few droplets remain liquid for about a millisecond even at this temperature. The hope now is that these observations and our detailed structural data will help identify those theories that best describe and explain the behaviour of water.},

  abstract = {The OH stretching vibrational spectrum of water was measured in a wide range of temperatures across the triple point, 269 K {\textless}T {\textless} 296 K, using Inelastic Neutron Scattering (INS). The hydrogen projected density of states and the proton mean kinetic energy, ⟨E K ⟩ OH , were determined for the first time within the framework of a harmonic description of the proton dynamics. We found that in the liquid the value of ⟨E K ⟩ OH is nearly constant as a function of T, indicating that quantum effects on the OH stretching frequency are weakly dependent on temperature. In the case of ice, ab initio electronic structure calculations, using non-local van der Waals functionals, provided ⟨E K ⟩ OH values in agreement with INS experiments. We also found that the ratio of the stretching (⟨E K ⟩ OH ) to the total (⟨E K ⟩ exp ) kinetic energy, obtained from the present measurements, increases in going from ice, where hydrogen bonding is the strongest, to the liquid at ambient conditions and then to the vapour phase, where hydrogen bonding is the weakest. The same ratio was also derived from the combination of previous deep inelastic neutron scattering data, which does not rely upon the harmonic approximation, and the present measurements. We found that the ratio of stretching to the total kinetic energy shows a minimum in the metastable liquid phase. This finding suggests that the strength of intermolecular interactions increases in the supercooled phase, with respect to that in ice, contrary to the accepted view that supercooled water exhibits weaker hydrogen bonding than ice.},

  abstract = {A comparison of chain-of-states based methods for finding minimum energy pathways (MEPs) is presented. In each method, a set of images along an initial pathway between two local minima is relaxed to find a MEP. We compare the nudged elastic band (NEB), doubly nudged elastic band, string, and simplified string methods, each with a set of commonly used optimizers. Our results show that the NEB and string methods are essentially equivalent and the most efficient methods for finding MEPs when coupled with a suitable optimizer. The most efficient optimizer was found to be a form of the limited-memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno method in which the approximate inverse Hessian is constructed globally for all images along the path. The use of a climbing-image allows for finding the saddle point while representing the MEP with as few images as possible. If a highly accurate MEP is desired, it is found to be more efficient to descend from the saddle to the minima than to use a chain-of-states method with many images. Our results are based on a pairwise Morse potential to model rearrangements of a heptamer island on Pt(111), and plane-wave based density functional theory to model a rollover diffusion mechanism of a Pd tetramer on MgO(100) and dissociative adsorption and diffusion of oxygen on Au(111).},

While the classical simulation based on conventional molecular dynamics has estimated the heat capacities too high, the quantum simulation based on path-integral molecular dynamics has given reasonable results based on the simple point-charge/flexible potential model. The calculated heat capacities (divided by the Boltzmann constant) in the quantum simulation are 3.1 in the vapor H2O at 300 K, 6.9 in the liquid H2O at 300 K, and 4.1 in the ice Ih H2O at 250 K, respectively, which are comparable to the experimental data of 3.04, 8.9, and 4.1, respectively. The quantum simulation also reproduces the isotope effect. The heat capacity in the liquid D2O has been calculated to be 10{\%} higher than that of H2O, while it is 13{\%} higher in the experiment. The results demonstrate that the path-integral simulation is a promising approach to quantitatively evaluate the heat capacities for molecular systems, taking account of quantum-mechanical vibrations as well as strongly anharmonic motions.},

It does not require the sampled energy range to be discretized to produce histograms, eliminating bias due to energy binning and significantly reducing the time complexity of computing a solution to the estimating equations in many cases. Additionally, an estimate of the statistical uncertainty is provided for all estimated quantities. In the large sample limit, MBAR is unbiased and has the lowest variance of any known estimator for making use of equilibrium data collected from multiple states. We illustrate this method by producing a highly precise estimate of the potential of mean force for a DNA hairpin system, combining data from multiple optical tweezer measurements under constant force bias.},

Each of these measurements represents a significant development of the x-ray diffraction technique applied to the study of liquid water. Sources of uncertainty from statistical noise, Q-range, Compton scattering, and self-scattering are discussed. The oxygen-hydrogen contribution to the measured x-ray scattering pattern was subtracted using literature data to yield an experimental determination, with error bars, of the oxygen-oxygen pair-distribution function, g(OO)(r), which essentially describes the distribution of molecular centers. The extended Q-range and low statistical noise of these measurements has significantly reduced truncation effects and related errors in the g(OO)(r) functions obtained. From these measurements and error analysis, the position and height of the nearest neighbor maximum in g(OO)(r) were found to be 2.80(1) Å and 2.57(5) respectively. Numerical data for the coherent differential x-ray scattering cross-section I(X)(Q), the oxygen-oxygen structure factor S(OO)(Q), and the derived g(OO)(r) are provided as benchmarks for calibrating force-fields for water.},

The silane molecule (SiH4) is adsorbed on to the surface at a number of different sites (on dimer, interrow, or intrarow) with varying barrier heights. Two distinct structures, which are similar in energy, arise from the initial dissociative reaction SiH4--{\textgreater}SiH3(silyl) + H, where the dissociated species are adsorbed either on the same dimer components or on adjacent dimer components. Several further decays of silyl from SiH4 are presented in two separate regimes of high and low ambient hydrogen coverages. The decomposition of silyl can form two different bridging structures: an on top or an intrarow bridging structure in both of the two hydrogen coverage regimes. The disilane molecule (Si2H6) is also adsorbed upon this surface with varying energy barriers, resulting in a dissociation reaction where two SiH3 species are adsorbed on one dimer or in an adjacent dimer configuration. Plausible energy reaction paths for the above models are presented. The stability of the SiH2 species is also discussed.},

We also find hyperparameters of the covariance function in the same joint optimization. The method can be viewed as a Bayesian regression model with particular input dependent noise. The method turns out to be closely related to several other sparse GP approaches, and we discuss the relation in detail. We finally demonstrate its performance on some large data sets, and make a direct comparison to other sparse GP methods. We show that our method can match full GP performance with small M, i.e. very sparse solutions, and it significantly outperforms other approaches in this regime.},

The resulting interface has zero density deficit in agreement with conclusions from positron lifetime studies.

In addition, nonlinear collective motions can be used as potentially efficient guides for biased simulation techniques. Here we present a simulation with a bias potential acting in the directions of collective motions determined by a nonlinear dimensionality reduction method. Ad hoc generated conformations of trans,trans-1,2,4-trifluorocyclooctane were analyzed by Isomap method to map these 72-dimensional coordinates to three dimensions, as described by Brown and co-workers [J. Chem. Phys. 129, 064118 (2008)]. Metadynamics employing the three-dimensional embeddings as collective variables was applied to explore all relevant conformations of the studied system and to calculate its conformational free energy surface. The method sampled all relevant conformations (boat, boat-chair, and crown) and corresponding transition structures inaccessible by an unbiased simulation. This scheme allows to use essentially any parameter of the system as a collective variable in biased simulations. Moreover, the scheme we used for mapping out-of-sample conformations from the 72D to 3D space can be used as a general purpose mapping for dimensionality reduction, beyond the context of molecular modeling.},

Coarse-grain molecular dynamics (CG-MD) is used herein to elaborate the structures and properties of diblock copolymer assemblies in water. By varying the hydrophilic/hydrophobic ratio of the copolymer in line with experiment, bilayer, cylindrical and spherical micelle morphologies spontaneously assemble. Varying the molecular weight (MW) with hydrophilic/hydrophobic ratio appropriate to a bilayer yields a hydrophobic core thickness that scales for large MW as a random coil polymer, in agreement with experiment. The extent of hydrophobic-segment overlap in the core increases nonlinearly with MW, indicative of chain entanglements and consistent with the dramatic decrease reported for lateral mobility in polymer vesicles. Calculated trends with MW as well as hydrophilic/hydrophobic ratio thus agree with experiment, demonstrating that CG-MD simulations provide a rational design tool for diblock copolymer assemblies.},

The crystalline fraction and grain size of these films determines electronic and optical properties; the nanocrystal nucleation mechanism, which dictates the final film structure, is governed by the interactions between the hydrogen atoms of the plasma and the solid silicon matrix. Fundamental understanding of these interactions is important for optimizing the film structure and properties. Here we report the mechanism of hydrogen-induced crystallization of hydrogenated amorphous silicon films during post-deposition treatment with an H(2) (or D(2)) plasma. Using molecular-dynamics simulations and infrared spectroscopy, we show that crystallization is mediated by the insertion of H atoms into strained Si-Si bonds as the atoms diffuse through the film. This chemically driven mechanism may be operative in other covalently bonded materials, where the presence of hydrogen leads to disorder-to-order transitions.},

Although metastable phases are ubiquitous in both nature and technology, only a heuristic understanding of their underlying ther- modynamics exists. We report a large-scale data-mining study of the Materials Project, a high-throughput database of density functional theory–calculated energetics of Inorganic Crystal Structure Database structures, to explicitly quantify the thermodynamic scale of metastability for 29,902 observed inorganic crystalline phases. We reveal the influence of chemistry and composition on the accessible thermodynamic range of crystalline meta- stability for polymorphic and phase-separating compounds, yielding new physical insights that can guide the design of novel metastable materials. We further assert that not all low-energy metastable compounds can necessarily be synthesized, and propose a principle of ‘remnant metastability'—that observable metastable crystalline phases are generally remnants of thermodynamic conditions where they were once the lowest free-energy phase.},

Quantum effects were included in the simulations through the Feynman-Hibbs effective potential. The simulation predictions show good agreement with the experimental results and suggest that the hydrogen isotope adsorption at 77 K can be successfully explained with the use of the effective potential. According to the simulations, the hydrogen isotopes are preferentially adsorbed in the cone part of the SWNH with a strong potential field, and quantum effects cause the density of adsorbed H(2) inside the SWNH to be 8-26{\%} smaller than that of D(2). The difference between H(2) and D(2) adsorption increases as pressure decreases because the quantum spreading of H(2), which is wider than that of D(2), is fairly effective at the narrow conical part of the SWNH model. These facts indicate that quantum effects on hydrogen adsorption depend on pore structures and are very important even at 77 K.},

It is emphasized that the adiabatic decoupling in CPMD is not a decoupling of electronic orbitals from the ions but only a decoupling of a subset of the orbital vibrational modes from the rest of the necessarily coupled system of orbitals and ions. Recent work [J. Chem. Phys. 116, 14 (2002)] has pointed out that, due to the orbital-ion coupling that remains once adiabatic decoupling has been achieved, a large value of the fictitious mass mu can lead to systematic errors in the computed forces in CPMD. These errors are further investigated in the present work with a focus on those parts of these errors that are not corrected simply by rescaling the masses of the ions. It is suggested that any comparison of the efficiencies of Born-Oppenheimer molecular dynamics (BOMD) and CPMD should be performed at a similar level of accuracy. If accuracy is judged according to the average magnitude of the systematic errors in the computed forces, the efficiency of BOMD compares more favorably to that of CPMD than previous comparisons have suggested.},

The human brain confronts the same problem in everyday perception, extracting from its high-dimensional sensory inputs-30,000 auditory nerve fibers or 10(6) optic nerve fibers-a manageably small number of perceptually relevant features. Here we describe an approach to solving dimensionality reduction problems that uses easily measured local metric information to learn the underlying global geometry of a data set. Unlike classical techniques such as principal component analysis (PCA) and multidimensional scaling (MDS), our approach is capable of discovering the nonlinear degrees of freedom that underlie complex natural observations, such as human handwriting or images of a face under different viewing conditions. In contrast to previous algorithms for nonlinear dimensionality reduction, ours efficiently computes a globally optimal solution, and, for an important class of data manifolds, is guaranteed to converge asymptotically to the true structure.},

Two general approaches are to vary the window width by the point of estimation and by point of the sample observation. The first possibility is shown to be of little efficacy in one variable. In particular, nearest-neighbor estimators in all versions perform poorly in one and two dimensions, but begin to be useful in three or more variables. The second possibility is more promising. We give some general properties and then focus on the popular Abramson estimator. We show that in many practical situations, such as normal data, a nonlocality phenomenon limits the commonly applied version of the Abramson estimator to bias of O([h/logh]2) instead of the hoped for O(h4).},

  abstract = {Poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) is an amphiphilic macromolecule with surfactant activity. The peculiar behavior of this polymer at the water-air interface is at the basis of its use as material for hydrated microdevices, films, and nanofibers. This work aims to investigate the behavior of PVA and water within the surface domain of highly diluted aqueous solutions by means of atomistic molecular dynamics simulations. Monodisperse atactic oligomers of 30 residues were distributed within water slabs in a vacuum box and allowed to diffuse toward the surface. After equilibration, structural features and dynamical properties of polymer chains and water in the interfacial domains were analyzed as a function of PVA surface concentration at 293 K. Surface pressure values obtained from simulations are in agreement with experimental values at corresponding polymer specific surface areas. In the explored concentration range of 6-34 {\$}\mu{\$}mol of residues/m(2), the chains display a transition between two states. At lower surface concentrations, elongated, quite rigid structures are adsorbed on the surface, whereas partially submerged globular aggregates, locally covered by thin water layers, are formed at higher surface concentrations. At PVA concentrations higher than about 20 {\$}\mu{\$}mol of residues/m(2), the percolation of chain aggregates over the interface plane produces a surface-confined polymer network with stable pores filled by water molecules. A substantial slowing of polymer and water dynamics in the interfacial domains is highlighted by the mean squared displacement time behavior of terminal residues and the interaction time of PVA-water hydrogen bonding. The diffusion coefficient of water and lifetime of hydrogen bonds between solvent molecules are halved and doubled, respectively, at the interface with the highest polymer concentration. The attenuation of water and polymer mobility concur to stabilize PVA hydrated networks in contact with air.},

We apply this approach to large-scale molecular dynamics simulations of liquid water, where we show that nanosecond second-harmonic scattering experiments contain a coherent contribution arising from radial and angular correlations on a length scale of ≲1 nm, much shorter than had been recently hypothesized (Shelton, D.

The computational approach, which employs modified functionals with short-ranged Hartree-Fock exchange, was first tested in calculations of the structural and bonding properties of the water dimer and cyclic water trimer. Liquid water simulations were performed at the state point of 350 K at the experimental density. Simulations included three different hybrid functionals, a meta-functional, four gradient-corrected functionals, and the local density and Hartree-Fock approximations. It is found that hybrid functionals are superior in reproducing the experimental structure and dynamical properties as measured by the radial distribution function and self-diffusion constant when compared to the pure density functionals. The local density and Hartree-Fock approximations show strongly over- and understructured liquids, respectively. Hydrogen bond analysis shows that the hybrid functionals give slightly smaller average numbers of hydrogen bonds than pure density functionals but similar hydrogen bond populations. The average molecular dipole moments in the liquid from the three hybrid functionals are lower than those of the corresponding pure density functionals.},

  abstract = {When examining complex problems, such as the folding of proteins, coarse grained descriptions of the system drive our investigation and help us to rationalize the results. Oftentimes collective variables (CVs), derived through some chemical intuition about the process of interest, serve this purpose. Because finding these CVs is the most difficult part of any investigation, we recently developed a dimensionality reduction algorithm, sketch-map, that can be used to build a low-dimensional map of a phase space of high-dimensionality. In this paper we discuss how these machine-generated CVs can be used to accelerate the exploration of phase space and to reconstruct free-energy landscapes. To do so, we develop a formalism in which high-dimensional configurations are no longer represented by low-dimensional position vectors. Instead, for each configuration we calculate a probability distribution, which has a domain that encompasses the entirety of the low-dimensional space. To construct a biasing potential, we exploit an analogy with metadynamics and use the trajectory to adaptively construct a repulsive, history-dependent bias from the distributions that correspond to the previously visited configurations. This potential forces the system to explore more of phase space by making it desirable to adopt configurations whose distributions do not overlap with the bias. We apply this algorithm to a small model protein and succeed in reproducing the free-energy surface that we obtain from a parallel tempering calculation.},

By means of incoherent inelastic neutron scattering and density functional theory calculations, the relaxation processes related to the methyl side-group reorientation were analyzed in detail. Our computational study demonstrates the importance of considering quantum effects to explain how methyl reorientations and subtle conformational changes of the molecule are intertwined. Indeed, by analyzing the quasi elastic signal of the neutron data, we were able to show a unique and complex motional flexibility in form II, reflected by a coupling between the methyl and the phenyl reorientation. This is associated with a higher energy barrier of the methyl rotation and a lower Gibbs free energy when compared to form I. We put forward the idea that correlating solubility and molecular flexibility, through the relation between pKa and methyl rotation activation energy, might bring new insights to understanding and predicting drug bioavailability.},

  abstract      = {Electric field induced second harmonic generation (EFISH) is an important experimental technique in extracting the first hyperpolarizability of an organic chromophore molecule. Such experiments are carried out in solutions with chromophore molecules dissolved in some common solvents. A known fact is that the first hyperpolarizabilities extracted from EFISH experiments are subject to the use of local field factors. In this work, we apply simulations to study the EFISH properties of chromophore solutions. By combining quantum chemistry calculations with the results derived from molecular dynamics simulations, we show how macroscopic EFISH properties can be modeled, using 4-(dimethylamino)-4'-nitroazobenzene dissolved in chloroform as a demonstration case. The focus of the study is on deriving accurate local field factors. We find that the local field approach applies very well to dipolar solutions, such as the one studied here, but that the local field factors derived are much smaller than the commonly used Onsager or Lorentz local field factors. Our study indicates that many of the reported first hyperpolarizabilities for dipolar molecules from EFISH experiments are most probably underestimated because the Onsager/Lorentz approach, commonly used in extracting the molecular first hyperpolarizability, neglects the effects of the shapes of dipolar chromophore molecules on the local field factors.},

  abstract = {Compared to other ions, protons (H(+)) and hydroxide ions (OH(-)) exhibit anomalously high mobilities in aqueous solutions. On a qualitative level, this behaviour has long been explained by 'structural diffusion' the continuous interconversion between hydration complexes driven by fluctuations in the solvation shell of the hydrated ions. Detailed investigations have led to a clear understanding of the proton transport mechanism at the molecular level. In contrast, hydroxide ion mobility in basic solutions has received far less attention, even though bases and base catalysis play important roles in many organic and biochemical reactions and in the chemical industry. The reason for this may be attributed to the century-old notion that a hydrated OH(-) can be regarded as a water molecule missing a proton, and that the transport mechanism of such a 'proton hole' can be inferred from that of an excess proton by simply reversing hydrogen bond polarities. However, recent studies have identified OH(-) hydration complexes that bear little structural similarity to proton hydration complexes. Here we report the solution structures and transport mechanisms of hydrated hydroxide, which we obtained from first-principles computer simulations that explicitly treat quantum and thermal fluctuations of all nuclei. We find that the transport mechanism, which differs significantly from the proton hole picture, involves an interplay between the previously identified hydration complexes and is strongly influenced by nuclear quantum effects.},

They are highly abundant in nature and their functional repertoire complements the functions of ordered proteins. IDPs are involved in regulation, signaling, and control, where binding to multiple partners and high-specificity/low-affinity interactions play a crucial role. Functions of IDPs are tuned via alternative splicing and posttranslational modifications. Intrinsic disorder is a unique structural feature that enables IDPs to participate in both one-to-many and many-to-one signaling. Numerous IDPs are associated with human diseases, including cancer, cardiovascular disease, amyloidoses, neurodegenerative diseases, and diabetes. Overall, intriguing interconnections among intrinsic disorder, cell signaling, and human diseases suggest that protein conformational diseases may result not only from protein misfolding, but also from misidentification, missignaling, and unnatural or nonnative folding. IDPs, such as alpha-synuclein, tau protein, p53, and BRCA1, are attractive targets for drugs modulating protein-protein interactions. From these and other examples, novel strategies for drug discovery based on IDPs have been developed. To summarize work in this area, we are introducing the D2 (disorder in disorders) concept.},

The method correctly reproduces fundamental frequencies obtained with quantum mechanical methods. At increasing temperatures, the effective frequencies are found to follow the same trends as path-integral based methods.

These observations were taken into account in a consistent comparison of a series of density functionals (BLYP, PBE, TPSS, OLYP, HCTH120, HCTH407). All simulations were carried out using an ab initio molecular dynamics approach in which wave functions are represented using Gaussians and the density is expanded in an auxiliary basis of plane waves.

  abstract = {Modeling point defects at an atomic scale requires careful treatment of the long-range atomic relaxations. This elastic field can strongly affect point defect properties calculated in atomistic simulations because of the finite size of the system under study. This is an important restriction for ab initio methods which are limited to a few hundred atoms. We propose an original approach coupling ab initio calculations and linear elasticity theory to obtain the properties of an isolated point defect for reduced supercell sizes. The reliability and benefit of our approach are demonstrated for three problematic cases: the self-interstitial in zirconium, clusters of self-interstitials in iron, and the neutral vacancy in silicon.},

Here, we present an ab initio molecular dynamics study that reveals, for the first time, the microscopic mechanism of this high proton conductivity. Anomalously fast proton transport in hydrogen-bonded systems involves a structural diffusion mechanism in which intramolecular proton transfer is driven by specific hydrogen bond rearrangements in the surrounding environment. Aqueous media transport excess charge defects through local hydrogen bond rearrangements that drive individual proton transfer reactions. In contrast, strong, polarizable hydrogen bonds in phosphoric acid produce coupled proton motion and a pronounced protic dielectric response of the medium, leading to the formation of extended, polarized hydrogen-bonded chains. The interplay between these chains and a frustrated hydrogen-bond network gives rise to the high proton conductivity.},

  abstract = {{\textcopyright} The Author(s) 2016. At the interface with solids, the mobility of liquid molecules tends to be reduced compared with bulk, often resulting in increased local order due to interactions with the surface of the solid. At room temperature, liquids such as water and methanol can form solvation structures, but the molecules remain highly mobile, thus preventing the formation of long-lived supramolecular assemblies. Here we show that mixtures of water with methanol can form a novel type of interfaces with hydrophobic solids. Combining in situ atomic force microscopy and multiscale molecular dynamics simulations, we identify solid-like two-dimensional interfacial structures that nucleate thermally, and are held together by an extended network of hydrogen bonds. On graphite, nucleation occurs above ∼ 35 °C, resulting in robust, multilayered nanoscopic patterns. Our findings could have an impact on many fields where water-alcohol mixtures play an important role such as fuel cells, chemical synthesis, self-assembly, catalysis and surface treatments.},

These results illustrate that the Urey model relies on a nontrivial cancellation of errors that can shift the apparent equilibrium temperature by as much as 35 K for a given distribution of isotopologues. The calculations reported here provide the same level of precision as the best existing analytical instrumentation, resolving the relative enrichment of certain isotopologues to as little as 0.01‰.

  abstract = {First, different approaches to detect hydrogen bonds and to evaluate their energies are introduced newly or are extended. Supermolecular interaction energies of 256 dimers, each containing one single hydrogen bond, were correlated to various descriptors by a fit function depending both on the donor and acceptor atoms of the hydrogen bond. On the one hand, descriptors were orbital-based parameters as the two-center or three-center shared electron number, products of ionization potentials and shared electron numbers, and the natural bond orbital interaction energy. On the other hand, integral descriptors examined were the acceptor-proton distance, the hydrogen bond angle, and the IR frequency shift of the donor-proton stretching vibration. Whereas an interaction energy dependence on 1/r(3.8) was established, no correlation was found for the angle. Second, the fit functions are applied to hydrogen bonds in polypeptides, amino acid dimers, and water cluster, thus their reliability is demonstrated. Employing the fit functions to assign intramolecular hydrogen bond energies in polypeptides, several side chain CH...O and CH...N hydrogen bonds were detected on the fly. Also, the fit functions describe rather well intermolecular hydrogen bonds in amino acid dimers and the cooperativity of hydrogen bond energies in water clusters.},

Matsubara dynamics is the quantum-Boltzmann-conserving classical dynamics which remains when real-time coherences are taken out of the exact quantum Liouvillian [T. J. H. Hele et al., J. Chem. Phys. 142, 134103 (2015)]; because of a phase-term, it cannot be used as a practical method without further approximation. Recently, Smith et al. [J. Chem. Phys. 142, 244112 (2015)]  developed a "planetary" model dynamics which conserves the Feynman-Kleinert (FK) approximation to the quantum-Boltzmann distribution. Here, we show that for moderately anharmonic potentials, the planetary dynamics gives a good approximation to Matsubara trajectories on the FK potential surface by decoupling the centroid trajectory from the locally harmonic Matsubara fluctuations, which reduce to a single phase-less fluctuation particle (the "planet"). We also show that the FK effective frequency can be approximated by a direct integral over these fluctuations, obviating the need to solve iterative equations. This modification, together with use of thermostatted ring-polymer molecular dynamics, allows us to test the planetary model on water (gas-phase, liquid, and ice) using the q-TIP4P/F potential surface. The "planetary" fluctuations give a poor approximation to the rotational/librational bands in the infrared spectrum, but a good approximation to the bend and stretch bands, where the fluctuation lineshape is found to be motionally narrowed by the vibrations of the centroid.},

  abstract = {We investigate the structure, topology, and dynamics of liquid water at the interface with natively hydroxylated (001) surfaces of InP and GaP photoelectrodes. Using ab initio molecular dynamics simulations, we show that contact with the semiconductor surface enhances the water hydrogen-bond strength at the interface. This leads to the formation of an ice-like structure, within which dynamically driven water dissociation and local proton hopping are amplified. Nevertheless, the structurally similar and isovalent InP and GaP surfaces generate qualitatively different interfacial water dynamics. This can be traced to slightly more covalent-like character in the binding of surface adsorbates to GaP, which results in a more rigid hydrogen-bond network that limits the explored topological phase space. As a consequence, local proton hopping can give rise to long-range surface proton transport on InP, whereas the process is kinetically limited on GaP. This allows for spatial separation of individual stages of hydrogen-evolving, multistep reactions on InP(001). Possible implications for the mechanisms of cathodic water splitting and photocorrosion on the two surfaces are considered in light of available experimental evidence.},

  abstract = {Atmospheric moisture cycling is an important aspect of the Earth's climate system, yet the processes determining atmospheric humidity are poorly understood. For example, direct evaporation of rain contributes significantly to the heat and moisture budgets of clouds, but few observations of these processes are available. Similarly, the relative contributions to atmospheric moisture over land from local evaporation and humidity from oceanic sources are uncertain. Lighter isotopes of water vapour preferentially evaporate whereas heavier isotopes preferentially condense and the isotopic composition of ocean water is known. Here we use this information combined with global measurements of the isotopic composition of tropospheric water vapour from the Tropospheric Emission Spectrometer (TES) aboard the Aura spacecraft, to investigate aspects of the atmospheric hydrological cycle that are not well constrained by observations of precipitation or atmospheric vapour content. Our measurements of the isotopic composition of water vapour near tropical clouds suggest that rainfall evaporation contributes significantly to lower troposphere humidity, with typically 20{\{}{\%}{\}} and up to 50{\{}{\%}{\}} of rainfall evaporating near convective clouds. Over the tropical continents the isotopic signature of tropospheric water vapour differs significantly from that of precipitation, suggesting that convection of vapour from both oceanic sources and evapotranspiration are the dominant moisture sources. Our measurements allow an assessment of the intensity of the present hydrological cycle and will help identify any future changes as they occur.},

  abstract = {In order to introduce flexibility into the simple point-charge (SPC) water model, the impact of the intramolecular degrees of freedom on liquid properties was systematically studied in this work as a function of many possible parameter sets. It was found that the diffusion constant is extremely sensitive to the equilibrium bond length and that this effect is mainly due to the strength of intermolecular hydrogen bonds. The static dielectric constant was found to be very sensitive to the equilibrium bond angle via the distribution of intermolecular angles in the liquid: A larger bond angle will increase the angle formed by two molecular dipoles, which is particularly significant for the first solvation shell. This result is in agreement with the work of Hochtl et al. [J. Chem. Phys. 109, 4927 (1998)]. A new flexible simple point-charge water model was derived by optimizing bulk diffusion and dielectric constants to the experimental values via the equilibrium bond length and angle. Due to the large sensitivities, the parametrization only slightly perturbs the molecular geometry of the base SPC model. Extensive comparisons of thermodynamic, structural, and kinetic properties indicate that the new model is much improved over the standard SPC model and its overall performance is comparable to or even better than the extended SPC model.},

Whereas hydrogen for transportation applications is currently stored using cryogenics or high pressure, there is substantial research and development activity in the use of novel condensed-phase hydride materials. However, the multiple-target criteria accepted as necessary for the successful implementation of such stores have not yet been met by any single material. Ammonia borane, NH3BH3, is one of a number of condensed-phase compounds that have received significant attention because of its reported release of approximately 12 wt{\%} hydrogen at moderate temperatures (approximately 150 degrees C). However, the hydrogen purity suffers from the release of trace quantities of borazine. Here, we report that the related alkali-metal amidoboranes, LiNH2BH3 and NaNH2BH3, release approximately 10.9 wt{\%} and approximately 7.5 wt{\%} hydrogen, respectively, at significantly lower temperatures (approximately 90 degrees C) with no borazine emission. The low-temperature release of a large amount of hydrogen is significant and provides the potential to fulfil many of the principal criteria required for an on-board hydrogen store.},

Although it is commonly accepted that the intrinsic deformation behaviour of these materials arises from the interplay between dislocation and grain-boundary processes, little is known about the specific deformation mechanisms. Here we use large-scale molecular-dynamics simulations to elucidate this intricate interplay during room-temperature plastic deformation of model nanocrystalline Al microstructures. We demonstrate that, in contrast to coarse-grained Al, mechanical twinning may play an important role in the deformation behaviour of nanocrystalline Al. Our results illustrate that this type of simulation has now advanced to a level where it provides a powerful new tool for elucidating and quantifying--in a degree of detail not possible experimentally--the atomic-level mechanisms controlling the complex dislocation and grain-boundary processes in heavily deformed materials with a submicrometre grain size.},

The merit of this procedure is that it allows a finite-difference evaluation of the virial estimator with respect to temperature, which totally avoids the need of higher-order potential derivatives. We apply this procedure to energy and heat-capacity calculations of the (H(2))(22) and Ne(13) clusters at low temperature using the fourth-order Takahashi-Imada [J. Phys. Soc. Jpn. 53, 3765 (1984)] and Suzuki [Phys. Lett. A 201, 425 (1995)] propagators. This type of calculation requires up to third-order potential derivatives if analytical virial estimators are used, but in practice only first-order derivatives suffice by virtue of the finite-difference scheme above. From the application to quantum clusters, we find that the fourth-order propagators do improve upon the primitive approximation, and that the choice of the reference point plays a vital role in reducing the variance of the virial estimator.},

The growth of semiconducting nanowires is a great tool to control crystal orientation and ensure a combination of light absorption and charge extraction for efficient photodetection. Thus far, however, leveraging the attributes of nanowires has remained seemingly incompatible with fiber materials, geometry, and processing approaches. Here, the integration of semiconducting nanowire-based devices at the tip and along the length of polymer fibers is demonstrated for the first time. The scalable thermal drawing process is combined with a simple sonochemical treatment to grow nanowires out of electrically addressed amorphous selenium domains. First principles density-functional theory calculations show that this approach enables to tailor the surface energy of crystal facets and favors nanowire growth along a preferred orientation, resulting in fiber-integrated devices of unprecedented performance. This novel platform is exploited to demonstrate an all-fiber-integrated fluorescence imaging system, highlighting novel opportunities in sensing, advanced optical probes, and smart textiles.},

Four bands of Bi;induced surface states are singled out and their dispersion is mapped along the high-symmetry directions of the surface Brillouin zone. The highest occupied state S' lies inside the InAs(110) energy gap at 0.2 eV binding energy and spreads across the Fermi level, determining the semimetallic character of the system. The second-highest occupied state Sn is located at 0.83 eV binding energy (at {\textless}(Gamma)over bar{\textgreater}), while states Sm and SN are located near the internal gap edge at 2.57 eV and 3.3 eV binding energy, and present band dispersions along {\textless}(Gamma)over bar{\textgreater}(X) over bar of similar to 340 meV and 300 meV, respectively. The Pi-induced bands of the (1 x 2) phase are shifted in energy relative to the corresponding bands of the (1 x 1)-Bi/InAs(110) phase and their width is reduced. These differences are discussed in the light of the geometric structure of the two phases.},

We show that the dipole-dipole correlation function of the liquid exhibits sizable oscillations over nanodomains of about 1.5 nm radius, with several isosbestic points as a function of temperature; the size of the nanodomains is nearly independent on temperature and density, between 240 and 400 K and 0.9 and 1.3 g/cm3, but it is substantially affected by the presence of solvated ions. In the same range of thermodynamic conditions, the decay time ($\tau$) of the system dipole moment varies by a factor of about 30 and 1.5, as a function of temperature and density, respectively. At 300 K, we observed a maximum in $\tau$ as a function of density, and a corresponding shallow maximum in the tetrahedral order parameter, in a range where the diffusion coefficient, the pressure and the dielectric constant increase monotonically.},

Such an improved description stems from two effects: a more accurate account, at the PBE0 level of theory, of the vibrational properties of the monomer and dimer and an underlying structural model for the liquid with a smaller number of hydrogen bonds and oxygen coordination than those obtained with semilocal functionals. The average electronic gap of the liquid is increased by 60{\%} with respect to the PBE value, when computed at the PBE0 level of theory, and is in fair agreement with experimental results.},

  abstract = {Two complementary strategies can be used in the fabrication of molecular biomaterials. In the 'top-down' approach, biomaterials are generated by stripping down a complex entity into its component parts (for example, paring a virus particle down to its capsid to form a viral cage). This contrasts with the 'bottom-up' approach, in which materials are assembled molecule by molecule (and in some cases even atom by atom) to produce novel supramolecular architectures. The latter approach is likely to become an integral part of nanomaterials manufacture and requires a deep understanding of individual molecular building blocks and their structures, assembly properties and dynamic behaviors. Two key elements in molecular fabrication are chemical complementarity and structural compatibility, both of which confer the weak and noncovalent interactions that bind building blocks together during self-assembly. Using natural processes as a guide, substantial advances have been achieved at the interface of nanomaterials and biology, including the fabrication of nanofiber materials for three-dimensional cell culture and tissue engineering, the assembly of peptide or protein nanotubes and helical ribbons, the creation of living microlenses, the synthesis of metal nanowires on DNA templates, the fabrication of peptide, protein and lipid scaffolds, the assembly of electronic materials by bacterial phage selection, and the use of radiofrequency to regulate molecular behaviors.},

  abstract = {A general and rigorous methodology to compute the quantum equilibrium isotope effect is described. Unlike standard approaches, ours does not assume separability of rotational and vibrational motions and does not make the harmonic approximation for vibrations or rigid rotor approximation for the rotations. In particular, zero point energy and anharmonicity effects are described correctly quantum mechanically. The approach is based on the thermodynamic integration with respect to the mass of isotopes and on the Feynman path integral representation of the partition function. An efficient estimator for the derivative of free energy is used whose statistical error is independent of the number of imaginary time slices in the path integral, speeding up calculations by a factor of approximately 60 at 500 K and more at room temperature. We describe the implementation of the methodology in the molecular dynamics package AMBER 10. The method is tested on three [1,5] sigmatropic hydrogen shift reactions. Because of the computational expense, we use ab initio potentials to evaluate the equilibrium isotope effects within the harmonic approximation and then the path integral method together with semiempirical potentials to evaluate the anharmonicity corrections. Our calculations show that the anharmonicity effects amount up to 30{\{}{\%}{\}} of the symmetry reduced reaction free energy. The numerical results are compared with recent experiments of Doering et al., [J. Am. Chem. Soc. 128, 9080 (2006); J. Am. Chem. Soc.129, 2488 (2007)] confirming the accuracy of the most recent measurement on 2,4,6,7,9-pentamethyl-5-(5,5-(2)H(2))methylene-11,11a-dihydro-12H-naphthacene as well as concerns about compromised accuracy, due to side reactions, of another measurement on 2-methyl-10-(10,10-(2)H(2))methylenebicyclo[4.4.0]dec-1-ene.},
