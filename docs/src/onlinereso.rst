i-PI resources
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For more information about i-PI and to download the source code go to
http://ipi-code.org/.

In http://gle4md.org/ one can also obtain colored-noise parameters to
run Path Integral with Generalized Langevin Equation thermostat
(PI+GLE/PIGLET) calculations.

Several examples of usage of i-PI to perform advanced molecular simulations
can be found among the recipes of the 
`atomistic cookbook <https://lab-cosmo.github.io/atomistic-cookbook/>`_.

Python resources
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For help with Python programming, see
`www.python.org <http://www.python.org>`__. For information about the NumPy
mathematical library, see `www.numpy.org <http://www.numpy.org>`__, and for
worked examples of its capabilities see
`www.scipy.org/Tentative_NumPy_Tutorial <http://www.scipy.org/Tentative_NumPy_Tutorial>`__.
Finally, see http://hgomersall.github.io/pyFFTW/ for documentation on
the Python FFTW library that is currently implemented with i-PI.


Client code resources
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Several codes provide out-of-the-box an i-PI interface, including 
ASE, 
CASTEP, 
CP2K,
DFTB+,
elphmod,
ffsGDML,
FHI-aims, 
LAMMPS, 
librascal, 
Quantum ESPRESSO, 
Siesta,
Yaff.

If you are interested in interfacing your code to i-PI please get in
touch, we are always glad to help!

There are several Fortran and C libraries that most client codes will
probably need to run, such as FFTW, BLAS and LAPACK. These can be found
at `www.fftw.org <http://www.fftw.org>`__,
`www.netlib.org/blas <http://www.netlib.org/blas>`__ and
`www.netlib.org/lapack <http://www.netlib.org/lapack>`__ respectively.

These codes do not come as part of the i-PI package, and must be
downloaded separately. 

.. See chapter :ref:`clientinstall` for more details of how to do this.
