====
i-PI: a Universal Force Engine
====

A Python interface for ab initio path integral molecular dynamics simulations.
i-PI is composed of a Python server (i-pi itself, that does not need to be
compiled but only requires a relatively recent version of Python and Numpy)
that propagates the (path integral) dynamics of the nuclei, and of an external
code that acts as a client and computes the electronic energy and forces.

This is typically a patched version of an electronic structure code, but a
simple self-contained Fortran driver that implements Lennard-Jones and
Silvera-Goldman potentials is included for test purposes.


Quick Setup and Test
====================

To use i-PI with already existing drivers, install using Pip::

   $ pip install git+https://github.com/i-pi/i-pi.git

To develop i-PI or test it with the self-contained driver, follow these
instructions. It is assumed that i-PI will
be run from a Linux environment, with a recent version of Python, Numpy and
gfortran, and that the terminal is initially in the i-pi package directory (the
directory containing this file).

Source the environment settings file :code:`env.sh` as :code:`$ source env.sh` or :code:`$ .
env.sh`.  It is useful to put this in your :code:`.bashrc` or other settings file if
you always want to have i-PI available.


Compile the driver code
-----------------------

::

  $ cd drivers
  $ make
  $ cd ..


Run one of the examples
-----------------------

This will first start the wrapper in the background, redirecting the output to
a log file, and then run a couple of instances of the driver code. The progress
of the wrapper is followed by monitoring the log file with the `tail` Linux
command.

Optionally, you can make a copy of the directory with the example somewhere
else if you want to keep the i-PI directory clean.

::

  $ cd examples/tutorial/tutorial-1/
  $ i-pi tutorial-1.xml > log &
  $ i-pi-driver -h localhost -p 31415 -m sg -o 15 &
  $ i-pi-driver -h localhost -p 31415 -m sg -o 15 &
  $ tail -f log

The monitoring can be interrupted with CTRL+C when the run has finished (5000 steps).


Run the automatic test suite
----------------------------

The automatic test suite can be run with the Python package `pytest` from the
root directory of the i-PI project.

::

  $ pytest -v


PEP-8 Compliance
================

i-PI code should be compliant to a minimal subset of PEP-8 recommendations.
Before proceeding to a pull request, or to the merging of a large commit, you
can use the following script to automatically prettify the code

```
i-pi-pepper -p $IPI_ROOT 
```
