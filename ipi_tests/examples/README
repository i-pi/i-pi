Automatic testing of examples 
=============================

This section of the tests is meant to check that all examples parse input correctly,
and can run a few steps without errors. It does NOT check that results are correct or
meaningful, so by default it runs with a "dummy" driver that just generate random
forces, energies and stress. Note that particularly unstable calculations might 
fail randomly because of this. 

Examples to be excluded from this test should be added to 'excluded_test.txt'

To run all the example tests you should use the script provided in  i-pi/bin/i-pi-tests. 
For details of usage call it with "-h" option.

If you would like to test only a subset of examples, you can have a look at the test_examples.py script 
that you find in this folder. To see more information type:

python test_examples.py -h
