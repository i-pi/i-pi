INFORMATION ON CREATING NEW REGRESSION TESTS
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

See the documentaion of how to run the regression tests by running:

   "python test_run.py -h"

To add a new regression test please provide:

   - input.xml (and all the files required by it)

   - driver.txt specifying  "<driver> <address> <port> <unix/inet> <-o possible
     options> " (see existing examples)
	The driver will be run using the following syntax*: 
 
	"i-pi-driver -m <driver> -h <address> -u -o <possible options>" if unix 
     
     for an existing example including the usage of option flags, please see:
	tests/GEOP/BFGS/harmonic/driver.txt

     *Please note that the driver can be run with the same syntax when one
     creates the reference files for the regression tests.

   
   - file_to_check.txt specifying the files serving as reference with their
     respective filenames

     for an existing example, please see:
	tests/INSTANTON/100K/files_to_check.txt

   - reference files that are listed in the files_to_check.txt file. Currently,
     the available formats are .xyz and numpy-accessible which should be
     specified with the keywords 'xyz' and 'numpy'.



Important: 

   The extension *.out appears in the .gitignore  file
   This means that the 'ref_simulation.out' file has to be added manually to your commit.
   You can do that by typing:

    "git add -f ref_simulation.out"

INFORMATION ABOUT THE CURRENTLY INCLUDED FEATURES IN THE REGRESSION TESTS
---------------------------------------------------------------------------


Thermostats and NVT dynamics  
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The following thermostats have been tested against an in-house independent
code by Yair Litman (2020) and hence have been included in the regression 
test analysis of i-pi. 
	- Langevin 
	- PILE-local (pile_l)
	- PILE-global (pile_g)
	- Stochastic Velocity Rescaling (SVR)
	 
Note, that these thermostats are tested with single bead and multiple bead
system settings, too. 


NVE dynamics 
---------------------------------------------------------------------- 
The classical and multibead NVE dynamics have been tested against the independent
implementation of Yair Litman (2020).



Geometry optimizations with FHI-aims against ASE:
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Note, that the results and accuracy of the geometry optimization routines have 
been tested against the ASE using FHI-aims and hartree fock with a strict 
convergence criteria. The tests have been conducted by Eszter Pos (2020) 

The following routines are tested and give perfect agreement:
	- BFGS
	- L-BFGS
	- BFGS-TRM
	- CG: there is an issue about the line-search of the CG routine, the
	      function needs to be evaluated ~100 times, while with ASE , the routine
	      converges after 7 steps. Needs to be checked further. Final geometry agrees
	      well enough with the ASE geometry, but the linesearch needs to be checked and
	      optimized. 

Partially tested, but problematic routines with FHI-aims against ASE:
	- SD: could not be tested against ASE, however, it gives the same final
optimized geometry as the BFGS routines. (takes a very long time becasue of
the line search.)
        - NEB: the Nudged Elastic Band routine is disabled until further
               debugging is conducted on the routine and its spring constants.

code by Yair Litman (2020) and hence have been included in the regression 
test analysis of i-pi. 
	- Langevin 
	- PILE-local (pile_l)
	- PILE-global (pile_g)
	- Stochastic Velocity Rescaling (SVR)
	 

Tested Instanton geometries and Hessian matrices
----------------------------------------------------------------------
For the instanton geometries and Hessian matrix, we rely on the
numpy-accessible outputs. 

These have been tested against Yair Litman's in-the-house independent implementation (2020).
