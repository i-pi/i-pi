INFORMATION ON CREATING NEW REGRESSION TESTS
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

See the documentaion of how to run the regression tests by running:

   "python test_run.py -h"

To add a new regression test please provide:

   - input.xml (and all the files required by it)

   - test_settings.dat 
     This file specifies the driver_model and flags that will be used when running
     the driver to perform the regression test.
     For examples including the usage of option flags, please see:
         tests/NVE/NVE_1/harmonic_python/test_settings.dat
         tests/NVE/NVE_1/harmonic/test_settings.dat

     *Please note that the driver can be run with the same syntax when one
     creates the reference files for the regression tests.

     **Please note that in the case of different drivers one should start to
     describe the setup of each driver by specifying driver_model xxxx in the 
     first line
   
   - file_to_check.txt specifying the files serving as reference with their
     respective filenames

     for an existing example, please see:
	tests/INSTANTON/100K/files_to_check.txt

   - reference files that are listed in the files_to_check.txt file. Currently,
     the available formats are .xyz and numpy-accessible which should be
     specified with the keywords 'xyz' and 'numpy'.



Important: 

   The extension *.out appears in the .gitignore  file
   This means that the 'ref_simulation.out' file has to be added manually to your commit.
   You can do that by typing:

    "git add -f ref_simulation.out"

INFORMATION ABOUT THE CURRENTLY INCLUDED FEATURES IN THE REGRESSION TESTS
---------------------------------------------------------------------------


Thermostats and NVT dynamics  
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The following thermostats have been tested against an in-house independent
code by Yair Litman (2020) and hence have been included in the regression 
test analysis of i-pi. 
	- Langevin 
	- PILE-local (pile_l)
	- PILE-global (pile_g)
	- Stochastic Velocity Rescaling (SVR)
	 
Note, that these thermostats are tested with single bead and multiple bead
system settings, too. 


NVE dynamics 
---------------------------------------------------------------------- 
The classical and multibead NVE dynamics have been tested against the independent
implementation of Yair Litman (2020).



Geometry optimizations with FHI-aims against ASE:
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Note, that the results and accuracy of the geometry optimization routines have 
been tested against the ASE using FHI-aims and hartree fock with a strict 
convergence criteria. The tests have been conducted by Eszter Pos (2020) 

The following routines are tested and give perfect agreement:
	- BFGS
	- L-BFGS
	- BFGS-TRM
	- CG: there is an issue about the line-search of the CG routine, the
	      function needs to be evaluated ~100 times, while with ASE , the routine
	      converges after 7 steps. Needs to be checked further. Final geometry agrees
	      well enough with the ASE geometry, but the linesearch needs to be checked and
	      optimized. 

Partially tested, but problematic routines with FHI-aims against ASE:
	- SD: could not be tested against ASE, however, it gives the same final
optimized geometry as the BFGS routines. (takes a very long time becasue of
the line search.)
        - NEB: the Nudged Elastic Band routine is disabled until further
               debugging is conducted on the routine and its spring constants. 
	


Tested Thermostats and NVT dynamics  
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The following thermostats have been tested against an in-house independent
code by Yair Litman (2020) and hence have been included in the regression 
test analysis of i-pi. 
	- Langevin 
	- PILE-local (pile_l)
	- PILE-global (pile_g)
	- Stochastic Velocity Rescaling (SVR)
	 

Tested Instanton geometries and Hessian matrices
----------------------------------------------------------------------
For the instanton geometries and Hessian matrix, we rely on the
numpy-accessible outputs. 

These have been tested against Yair Litman's in-the-house independent implementation (2020).


XTRA-JSON regression tests checking the capabilities of the JSON infrastructure
----------------------------------------------------------------------
These tests have been tested by Eszter Pos's (2020) dummy friction-tensor and dipole
implemented in the doublewell_1D potential and using the existing dipole
implemented in the zundel potential. The tests are comparing numpy-accessible
output trajectory files.  


Tested NPT dynamics  
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The following features have been tested by Venkat Kapil (2021) 
    - VT curve for an ideal gas in the NPzT ensemble
    - PV curve for an ideal gas in the NPzT ensemble
