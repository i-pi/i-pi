INFORMATION ON CREATING NEW REGRESSION TESTS
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

See the documentaion of how to run the regression tests by running:

   "python test_run.py -h"

To add a new regression test please provide:

   - input.xml (and all the files required by it)

   - test_settings.dat 
     This file specifies the driver_model and flags that will be used when running
     the driver to perform the regression test.
     For examples including the usage of option flags, please see:
         tests/NVE/NVE_1/harmonic_python/test_settings.dat
         tests/NVE/NVE_1/harmonic/test_settings.dat

     *Please note that the driver can be run with the same syntax when one
     creates the reference files for the regression tests.

     **Please note that in the case of different drivers one should start to
     describe the setup of each driver by specifying driver_model xxxx in the 
     first line
   
   - file_to_check.txt specifying the files serving as reference with their
     respective filenames

     for an existing example, please see:
	tests/INSTANTON/100K/files_to_check.txt

   - reference files that are listed in the files_to_check.txt file. Currently,
     the available formats are .xyz and numpy-accessible which should be
     specified with the keywords 'xyz' and 'numpy'.

   - (For the moment) We assume a very specific syntax for the file names. 
     The reference file name should be the same as the output file name with the addition of 'ref_' at the beginning, example:

     reference file: ref_simulation.out
     output to be genererated from i-pi: simulation.out


Important: 

   The extension *.out appears in the .gitignore  file
   This means that the 'ref_simulation.out' file has to be added manually to your commit.
   You can do that by typing:

    "git add -f ref_simulation.out"
