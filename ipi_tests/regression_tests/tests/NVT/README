Tested Thermostats and NVT dynamics  
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The following thermostats have been tested against an in-house independent
code by Yair Litman (2020) and hence have been included in the regression 
test analysis of i-pi. 
	- Langevin 
	- PILE-local (pile_l)
	- PILE-global (pile_g)
	- Stochastic Velocity Rescaling (SVR)
