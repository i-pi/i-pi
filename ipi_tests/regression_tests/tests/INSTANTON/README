Tested Instanton geometries and Hessian matrices
----------------------------------------------------------------------
For the instanton geometries and Hessian matrix, we rely on the
numpy-accessible outputs. 

These have been tested against Yair Litman's in-the-house independent implementation (2020).

Implicit bath has been tested against explicit bath calculations (Dec 2023)
