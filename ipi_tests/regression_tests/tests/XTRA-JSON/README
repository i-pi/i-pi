XTRA-JSON regression tests checking the capabilities of the JSON infrastructure
----------------------------------------------------------------------
These tests have been tested by Eszter Pos's (2020) dummy friction-tensor and dipole
implemented in the doublewell_1D potential and using the existing dipole
implemented in the zundel potential. The tests are comparing numpy-accessible
output trajectory files.
