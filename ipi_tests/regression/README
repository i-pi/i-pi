To add a new regression test please provide:

- input.xml (and all the files required by it)
- driver.txt specifing  "<driver> <address> <port> <unix/inet> " (see existing examples)
- a reference output with the name 'ref_simulation.out'

Important: 
The extension *.out appears in .gitignore 
so 'ref_simulation.out'  has to be added manually to your commit.
You can doing in the following way:
git add -f ref_simulation.out 

TODO :  
    - Implement check comparison of geometry/velocity/forces files
