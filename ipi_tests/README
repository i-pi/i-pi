 * A the moment we can perform three type of tests:
   
    -unitary test: These tests check basic functionality of the code, like io from/to xyz files is working properly

    -example test: These tests search for all the examples provided in the i-pi/examples folder and check
                   the integrity of the corresponding input files by running i-PI for a few steps with a toy model.

    -regression_test: These test check complex functionality by running i-PI for a few steps and comparing the output obatained
                      against reference results. You can find all the regression tests inside i-pi/ipi_test/regression_tests/tests/ 

 * To run the tests, please use i-pi/bin/i-pi-tests. For details of usage call it with "-h" option.


 * In some situations it is desirable to perform regresion/examples tests only for a selected set.
   For these cases, we also provide more flexible scripts for performing the regresion tests and testing the provided examples.
   See i-pi/ipi_tests/regression_tests/test_run.py and i-pi/ipi_tests/examples/test_examples.py, respectively. 
   For details of usage call them with "-h" option.
