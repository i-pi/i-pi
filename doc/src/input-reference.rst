Input file reference
====================

This chapter gives a complete list of the tags that can be specified in
the xml input file, along with the hierarchy of objects. Note that every
xml input file must start with the root tag . See the accompanying
“help.xml” file in the “doc/help_files” directory to see the recommended
input file structure.

Each section of this chapter describes one of the major input classes
used in the i-PI initialization. These sections will start with some
normal text which describes the function of this class in detail. After
this the attributes of the tag will be listed, enclosed within a frame
for clarity. Finally, the fields contained within the tag will be listed
in alphabetical order, possibly followed by their attributes.
**Attribute** names will be bold and **field** names both bold and
underlined. *Other supplementary information* will be in small font and
italicized.
