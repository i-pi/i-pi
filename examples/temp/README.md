Instructions to add new examples

Please provide an input.xml file, as well as all the files required by it (like geometry files, hessian files, etc)

All the example should be called by typing:

 i-pi input.xml

 <call driver>

In some cases some extra comands may be required. Please add a README file with such instructions.

Finally, all the examples are tested by our automatic workflow using a dummy driver. 
In some very particular cases some specific instructions have to be provided.
Please add a file named 'test_settings.dat' with the corresponding information
(See for example in lammps/h2o-imf/test_settings.dat)
