 -- Example with the 1D harmonic oscillator code --

 * This gives an example of a Hydrogen atom in a 1D harmonic potential well.
   The input file is set up so that the spring constant of the harmonic oscillator 
   is set to k = 0.2.

 * To run, first compile the driver code in drivers/. This should be as 
   simple as: 

$ make

 * Next, source the env.sh file in the i-pi root.

$ source i-pi-root/env.sh

** Run the examples automatically:
 
 * A Makefile is provided to run this example. To run simply use:

$ make harmonic

 * To clean up output files:

$ make clean


** Run the examples manually:

 * Go to the i-pi root directory and from there

$ source env.sh

 * Go back to the example directory and run

$ i-pi input.xml
 
   the wrapper will start and sit waiting on the UDS /tmp/ipi
 
 * Open a separate terminal and run the harmonic oscillator driver code 
 
$ i-pi-driver -u -h harmonic -m harm -o 0.2

   You can run multiple instances of the code; it is so fast that parallel 
   scaling won't be appreciable.

 * If your system does not support Unix domain sockets, just set in input.xml
   <socket mode="inet"> <port> port_no </port>

  then run the driver as:

$ i-pi-driver -h harmonic -m harm -o 1 -p port_no
