Harmonic Calculations
=================================================

FD-Phonons: phonons calculation for a paracetamol crystal using LAMMPS as force-provider. The PES is modeled with the GAFF forcefield.
FD-NormalModes: normal mode calculation for a water molecule using LAMMPS as force-provider. The PES is modeled with the qTIP4P/f forcefield.
