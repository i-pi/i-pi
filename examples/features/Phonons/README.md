Phonons calculation
=================================================

lammps_paracetamol: phonons calculation for a paracetamol crystal using LAMMPS as force-provider. The PES is modeled with the GAFF forcefield.
lammps_h2o_molecule: normal mode calculation for a water molecule using LAMMPS as force-provider. The PES is modeled with the qTIP4P/f forcefield.
