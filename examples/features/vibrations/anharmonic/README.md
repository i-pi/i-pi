Anharmonic Vibrations  
=================================================

IMF: Independent Mode Framework to calculate the (approximate) anharmonic vibrational energies for a solid. This approach incorporates anharmonicity along phonons but not their coupling. 
VSCF2: Vibrational self-consistent field to calculate the (approximate) anharmonic vibrational energies for a solid. This approach incorporates anharmonicity along phonons and their coupling up to a body-order of two within a mean-field approach.
SCP: Self-consistent phonons calculation to find the best harmonic approximation to a solid's PES.
