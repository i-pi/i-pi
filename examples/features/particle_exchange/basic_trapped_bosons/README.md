Trapped cold non-interacting bosons
=================================================
`trapped_bosons_3`: 3 noninteracting bosons in a 3D anisotropic harmonic trap. The analytical total energy is 0.00058031 Ha.
`trapped_bosons_2_distinguishable_1`: a mixture of 2 noninteracting bosons and 1 additional non-interacting distinguishable particle, in a 3D anisotropic harmonic trap. The analytical total energy is 0.00062348 Ha.

Both differ from the result for 3 distinguishable particles, which is 0.00065142 Ha.

The total energy is obtained by summing the properties 'potential' for the potential energy, and either -'virial_fq' or 'kinetic_td'.
