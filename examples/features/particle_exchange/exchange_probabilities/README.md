Bosonic exchange probabilities
=================================================
An example of recording the extent to which the dynamics are affected by bosonic exchange. Bosonic exchange creates a superposition of multiple ring polymer configurations, some of which combine the rings of several atoms together.
The property 'exchange_distinct_prob' is the probability of the ordinary, distinguishable configuration, where each atom is in its own separate ring.
When exchange has a significant effect, 'exchange_distinct_prob' is close to 0; when it has no effect, it is close to 1.
The property 'exchange_all_prob' is the probability of the other extreme, the configuration that connects all the atoms together into a single ring, scaled by 1/N. In the limit of low temperatures it converges to 1.
