Metadynamics calculations using PLUMED
======================================

These examples can be run using the Zundel PES implemented in the i-pi driver,

```bash
i-pi--driver -u -h zundel -m zundel
```

However, they require having PLUMED libraries and Python bindings in the appropriate system paths.
