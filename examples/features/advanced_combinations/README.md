Examples of advanced features
=============================

This folder contains examples that are somewhat more complicated, requiring
either a particular setup of the drivers, or post-processing of the output. 
More thoroughly-commented examples of advanced simulations can be found in the
`demos` folder: these are more minimalistic, and probably require careful study
of the reference papers to fully understand the simulation setup. 

`cav_md`: Cavity molecular dynamics (CavMD) simulation of liquid water under vibrational strong coupling
`spatially_localized_rpc`: Spatially localized ring-polymer contraction
