Cavity molecular dynamics of liquid water under vibrational strong coupling
=======================

This runs a cavity molecular dynamics (CavMD) simulation of liquid water under vibrational strong coupling. 

In this simulation, an infrared cavity mode at 3550 cm<sup>-1</sup> is strongly coupled to the O-H stretch mode of liquid water along both the x and y directions. Due to this strong coupling, the O-H stretch band of liquid water is splitted to two eigenstates, known as polaritons.

See the paper [Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., 2020, 117 (31), 18324â€“18331](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2009272117) or [https://github.com/TaoELi/cavity-md-ipi](https://github.com/TaoELi/cavity-md-ipi) for more details of CavMD.

This example is the same as the [Rabi splitting tutorial](https://github.com/TaoELi/cavity-md-ipi/tree/master/tutorials/Rabi_splitting) in [https://github.com/TaoELi/cavity-md-ipi](https://github.com/TaoELi/cavity-md-ipi). The only difference is that in the original [Rabi splitting tutorial](https://github.com/TaoELi/cavity-md-ipi/tree/master/tutorials/Rabi_splitting), the parameters for the photons are controlled by a separate input file **photon_params.json**. Here, instead, the photon parameters are controlled in the **ffcavphsocket** section of the i-pi input file **input.xml**. 

**Important**: At the moment this implementation assumes that the total dipole moment is a sum of atomic charges which are fixed during the simulation. While an extension to use on-the-fly dipole moments obtained from the drive is possible, it has not been implemented at the moment. If you are interested in this feature please contact us or use the [development version of the CavMD code](https://github.com/TaoELi/cavity-md-ipi).

In short, to perform CavMD simulations, we need to make **two modifications** of conventional i-pi simulations.

1. We use the following force evaluator **ffcavphsocket** instead of the original **ffsocket**. In this new force evaluator, **E0** denotes the effective light-matter coupling strength in atomic units (corresponding to the \tilde{varepsilon} parameter in the [original paper](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2009272117)). **omega_c_cminv** denotes the cavity photon mode frequency in wave number. **charge_array** defines the partial charges of all atoms in the same order as the input xyz file. Note that the total size of **charge_array** should match the total number of nuclei, otherwise a **ValueError** will be raised.

```
  <ffcavphsocket name='lammps' mode='unix' pbc='True'>
    <address>h2o-cl-cavmd</address>
    <latency> 1e-3 </latency>
    <apply_photon> True </apply_photon>
    <E0> 4e-4 </E0>
    <omega_c units='inversecm'> 3550.0 </omega_c>
    <charge_array> [-0.8192, 0.4096, 0.4096, ...] </charge_array>
  </ffcavphsocket>
```

2. We also need to put photons in the input xyz file.

       O  2.38972e+00  2.62791e-01  5.65120e+00
       H  1.41821e+00  1.87797e-01  5.65303e+00
       H  2.50853e+00  2.13428e-01  4.67340e+00
       ...
       L -8.65101e+00  1.11541e+00  4.56823e-01
       L  5.35376e-01  1.20389e+01 -1.19497e-01
```
Here, we have 216 water molecules (648 nuclei) and two photons (labeled as **L**). Please always put the photons at the very end of the xyz file. The mass of each photon is 1.0 atomic units by default. We assume a z-direction oriented optical cavity coupled to the molecules, so the k-vector of the cavity photons is along the z-direction, and the cavity photons can polarize along either the x- or y-direction. The first photon is coupled to the x direction of the total dipole moment of water, and the second photon is coupled to the y direction. Hence, for the first photon "atom", only the x coordinate is influenced by the molecules; for the second photon "atom", only the y coordinate is influenced by the molecules. In the current implementation, only two cavity photons are supported (more advanced cavity setups will be included in an updated version of the code).
