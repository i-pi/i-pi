Machine learning committee
=================================================

`committee`: Creates a committee forcefield from a set of force providers and stores uncertainty attributes as extras.
`baselined_committee`: Creates a committee forcefield using a baseline and a committee of "delta" learned models. Includes a feature to supress the delta correction smoothly if its uncertainty increases beyond a cutoff.
