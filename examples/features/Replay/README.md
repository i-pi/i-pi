Replay functionality
=================================================

This functionality allows to go over a trajectory and obtain properties.
Possible applications:
  - compute forces and energies with a different client to the one use to obtain the trajectory
  - compute properties that are computationally more demanding that forces every n amount of steps (instead of every step) .
