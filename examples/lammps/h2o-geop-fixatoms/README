Geometry optimization test: 1 water molecule in vacuum
with different numbers of freezed atoms.

To launch a geometry optmization test for a certain optimizer, type 
./run-all-tests.sh <mode>, 
where mode is bfgs, bfgstrm, lbfgs, cg or sd.

resulting files are 
log.[0-3]-fixed.<mode>.lmp
log.[0-3]-fixed.<mode>.ipi
sim-[0-3]-fixed.<mode>.pos_0.xyz

0-3 means the number of atoms fixed in a water molecule.
    0 and 1 are expected to give the same energy, 
    2 should give the different energy, 
    3 should throw warning "all atoms are fixed" and do nothing.

'far-away' folder gives the comparison of optimization with and without constraints 
for the system, where constraint doesn't matter: 
1 very distant atom (far beyond the interaction range) in addition to perturbed water molecule.
Here relaxation WITH and WITHOUT fixatom should give equal result and completely equal relaxation trajectory.

'count-force-calls.sh' allows to compare performance (and also check for 
the old bug with forces called twice per geop step)


RESULTS:
All optimizers pass this test successfully and give the same energies and structures (wrt defined tolerances).
But CG and SD have HUGE problems with convergence. It is unrelated to fixatoms.
