 -- Example with the rudimentary LJ code --

 * This gives an example of Neon with a Lennard-Jones potential 
   pair potential, which can be compared to the following data:

   - low_density: Loup Verlet, Phys. Rev. 159, 1, (1967)
           State point (N, rho, T) = (864, 0.35, 1.620)
   - mid_density: Loup Verlet, Phys. Rev. 159, 1, (1967)
           State point (N, rho, T) = (864, 0.75, 1.069)
   - high_density: Loup Verlet, Phys. Rev. 159, 1, (1967)
           State point (N, rho, T) = (864, 0.88, 1.095)

   Note that the last one appears to illustrate a typo in the paper, since
   the potental energy as found by this wrapper and by the LAMMPS MD code
   are both -5.86 rather than -5.66 as reported in the original paper.

 * First, compile the driver code in drivers/. This should be as simple as: 

$ make

 * Next, create a make.in
   file containing the path to the driver.x executable and i-pi, e.g.

driver:=~/bin/driver.x
IPI:=~/bin/i-pi


** Run the examples automatically:
 
 * These can be run automatically using the Makefile provided. The make 
   targets are self-explanatory -- high_density, mid_density and low_density. 
   To run the high density example, for instance, just type:

$ make high_density

 * To clean up output files:

$ make clean


** Run the examples manually:

 * Go back to the example directory and run

$ python path/i-pi input.xml
 
   the wrapper will start and sit waiting on the UDS /tmp/ipi.
 
 * Open a separate terminal and run the LJ driver code. Each of the tests
   runs using a different server address, which are indentical to their
   directory names. For example, the high density problem is run using:
 
$ path/drivers/driver.x -u -h high_density -m lj -o 5.270446,1.1663e-4,13.176115

   You can run multiple instances of the code; it is so fast that parallel 
   scaling won't be appreciable.

 * If your system does not support Unix domain sockets, just set in input.xml
   <socket mode="inet"> <port> port_no </port>

  then run the driver as:

$ path/drivers/driver.x -h high_density -m lj 
  -o 5.270446,1.1663e-4,13.176115 -p port_no
