i-PI demonstrations
===================

These examples provide more sophisticated and realistic simulations setups, that 
demonstrate the usage of i-PI in a number of actual application scenarios. 
This README provide an overview of the content of the various folders.


p-H2: a tutorial
----------------

This is an introductory tutorial demonstrating classical and quantum simulations
of para-hydrogen close to a phase transition. The example is discussed as a tutorial
as part of the main documentations of i-PI. 


Alchemical isotope exchanges
----------------------------

This example demonstrates the use of the alchemical isotope exchange method, which simplifies
sampling equilibrium isotope fractionation between different molecular sites or different
thermodynamic phases of matter.
