This example is based on the lammps/benz-graph-slc/,
which requires multiple clients to be connected to the same i-PI instance.

Here we launch i-PI and Lammps instances in the same Slurm script.
Here particularly all tasks run on the same HPC node, but it would work exactly the same
with multiple nodes.
