  NOTE: These examples are provided as a template to use i-pi and quantum 
  Espresso, and are designed to run (relatively) quickly on a normal 
  workstation. The parameters of both the path integral MD and electronic 
  structure calculation are NOT converged and should not be used verbatim 
  in production calculations.

                  -- Running the q-Espresso example --

 * First, it is necessary to patch and compile q-Espresso, and create a make.in
   file containing the path to pw.x and i-pi, e.g.

PW:=~/bin/pw.x
IPI:=~/bin/i-pi



** Run the examples automatically:
 
 * To run the water example, just type:

$ make water

 * To run the lithium example, just type
 
$ make lithium

 * To clean up output files:

$ make clean


  
** Run the examples manually:
 
 * In the main example directory run 

$ python path/src/i-pi lithium.xml
 
 * In another terminal, create up to 8 temporary directories to run pw.x,
 and launch it from within:
 
$ mkdir run_1
$ cd run_1
$ $PW < ../h2o_pw.in
 
 * Repeat several times to get multiple instances
 
 * To run q-Espresso remotely, you should:
    1. make sure that the machine you run i-pi on has a port accessible 
       from outside
    2. change the <interface> option in lithium.xml so that <address> points 
       to the external network interface (i.e. give a fully-qualified domain 
       name or IP address rather than localhost) and that the <port>
       selected is accessible from outside
    3. change the srvaddress input parameter in driver.in, making it point to 
       the same address and port
    4. copy the pw.x inputs to the remote machine (do not forget the pseudos!) 
       and launch n copies of pw-driver.x remotely
