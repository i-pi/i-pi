The example folders is structured in the three folders, each one with a different focused on a different aspect

- **clients**  :    Contains examples that are code-specific, highlighting how the driver code should be set up
                   (client-specific syntax and tags) to run it properly with i-PI

- **features**:    Examples of different functionalities implemented in i-pi. 
                   All examples can be run locally with the drivers provided with the code.

- **demos**   :    Ready-to-use simple and complex setups that actually run meaningful simulations
                   for actual physical systems production runs
              
- **HPC-submission-examples**     :    Examples of submission scripts in HPC platforms

- **temp**    :    Temporary folder with historice examples that have not yet been adapted
                   to the current folder structure

- **init_files**: repository of input files used by many examples

We keep this folder updated as much as we can, 
please report  in the git repo iff you find something that is not working. 
We will try to fix it as soon as possible.
