The example folders is structured in the three folders, each one with a different focused on a different aspect

- **clients**  :    Contains examples that are code-specific, highlighting how the driver code should be set up
                   (client-specific syntax and tags) to run it properly with i-PI

- **features**:    Examples of different functionalities implemented in i-PI. 
                   All examples can be run locally with the drivers provided with the code.

- **hpc-jobs**     :    Examples of submission scripts on HPC platforms

- **temp**    :    Temporary folder with historic examples that have not yet been adapted
                   to the current folder structure

- **init_files**: repository of input files used by many examples

We keep this folder updated as much as we can, please report a bug if you find something that 
is not working. We will try to fix it as soon as possible.
