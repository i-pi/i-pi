# Contributing

i-PI is an open-source project that welcomes contributions from any developers at any point.
We strongly encourage that, if you want to add a new feature to the code, you go ahead and do so.
Below we list a few steps that you can follow in order to make these changes.

Contributing to i-PI is easy and straightforward. We are compiling a list of steps you should
ensure before opening a pull request in our documentation ([contributing page (follow link)][docpage]). 

Contributions are only merged after successfully passed all the CI tests in the repository 
(make sure this is the case!) and an approving review by one of the maintainers.
