            ! Calculates the vector separating two atoms.

            ! Note that minimum image convention is used, so only the image of
            ! atom j that is the shortest distance from atom i is considered.
            !
            ! Also note that while this may not work if the simulation
            ! box is highly skewed from orthorhombic, as
            ! in this case it is possible to return a distance less than the
            ! nearest neighbour distance. However, this will not be of 
            ! importance unless the cut-off radius is more than half the 
            ! width of the shortest face-face distance of the simulation box,
            ! which should never be the case.
