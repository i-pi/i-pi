Solid-liquid free energy with uncertainty quantification
========================================================

This example demonstrates a rather sophisticated setup to compute the $\Delta\mu_{SL}$ 
for the ice/water system using an ensemble of ML potentials, including an evaluation of
the uncertainty using a direct propagation of the ensemble (cf. [Imbalzano2021, Kellner2024]).
