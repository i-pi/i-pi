    Everything is stored as (nbeads,3*natoms) sized contiguous arrays,
    and a convenience-access to each replica of the system is provided through a
    list of Atoms objects. Contains arrays of both the normal mode representation
    and the position representation, and various sized arrays for the atom
    labels and masses. Also contains the potential and force between
    neighbouring replicas.

    Attributes:
       natoms: The number of atoms.
       nbeads: The number of beads.
       _blist: A list of Atoms objects for each replica of the system. Each
          replica is assumed to have the same mass and atom label.
       centroid: An atoms object giving the centroid coordinate of the beads.

    Depend objects:
       names: An array giving the atom names.
       m: An array giving the atom masses.
       m3: An array giving the mass associated with each degree of freedom.
       sm3: An array giving the square root of m3.
       q: An array giving all the bead positions.
       p: An array giving all the bead momenta.
       qc: An array giving the centroid positions. Depends on qnm.
       pc: An array giving the centroid momenta. Depends on pnm.
       vpath: The spring potential between the beads, divided by omegan**2.
          Depends on q.
       fpath: The spring force between the beads, divided by omegan**2.
          Depends on q.
       kins: A list of the kinetic energy of each replica.
       kin: The total kinetic energy of the system. Note that this is not the
          same as the estimate of the kinetic energy of the system, which is
          contained in the properties module.
       kstress: The total kinetic stress tensor for the system.
       rg: An array giving the radius of gyration of each atom.
