"""Classes used to generate pseudo-random numbers.

Allows the user to specify a seed for the random number generator.
These are used in initialising the velocities and in stochastic thermostats.
The state of the random number generator is kept track of, so that the if the
simulation is restarted from a checkpoint, we will see the same dynamics as if
it had not been stopped.

    Attributes:
        rng: The random number generator to be used.
        seed: The seed number to start the generator.
        state: A tuple of five objects giving the current state of the random

            here 'MT19937', the second is an array of 624 integers, the third
            is the current position in the array that is being read from, the
            fourth gives whether it has a gaussian random number stored, and
            the fifth is this stored Gaussian random number, or else the last
