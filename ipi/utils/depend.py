"""Tools that deal with the dependency detection, value caching and automatic
updating of variables.

The classes defined in this module overload the standard __get__ and __set__
routines of the numpy ndarray class and standard library object class so that
they automatically keep track of whether anything they depend on has been
altered, and so only recalculate their value when necessary.

Basic quantities that depend on nothing else can be manually altered in the
usual way, all other quantities are updated automatically and cannot be changed
directly.

The exceptions to this are synchronized properties, which are in effect
multiple basic quantities all related to each other, for example the bead and
normal mode representations of the positions and momenta. In this case any of
the representations can be set manually, and all the other representations
must keep in step.

For a more detailed discussion, see the reference manual.
